<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> chapters composing this book originally appeared
as a series of articles in <cite>The Engineer</cite> during January,
February, and March of the current year. The articles
were written in the belief that many readers would
welcome a clear and full, non-mathematical exposition of
the gyroscopic compass, its theory and practical construction.
The gyro-compass represents at once the most
involved and abstruse and the most important and
valuable of all the practical applications to which the
gyroscope, so far, has been put. As a navigational
instrument it is now in practically universal use in all the
chief war navies of the world, and is to-day being adopted
by several important representatives of the mercantile
marine. Remarkable figures were shown to the author
recently which demonstrated that not only was navigation
by the gyro-compass much more accurate than by
the magnetic compass, but that the increased accuracy
reduced the length of the voyage of a mercantile vessel
to an extent that resulted in saving a quantity of fuel
the value of which on a single trip would go a considerable
way towards meeting the extra first cost of the gyro-compass.
Bearing these facts in mind the author from
the outset endeavoured not only to dispense with
mathematics but to avoid introducing anything except
the most familiar physical principles and conceptions, for
his object was to explain the mode of action of the gyro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>-compass
for the benefit primarily of the navigating
officer—naval and mercantile. If some readers should
find the treatment in places unduly prolix, the author
trusts they will exercise leniency and regard the fault as
being caused by the author’s unwillingness to take any
risks in expounding a subject, no part of which can be
understood incompletely without grave hurt to the
understanding of the whole.</p>

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">At</span> this date it is, or should be, unnecessary to open an
account of the gyroscopic compass with a discussion of
the defects of the ordinary magnetic compass. These
defects are too well known to require mention. Recent
advances in naval architecture, particularly in warship
construction, and very especially the building of
submarines, have resulted in the magnetic compass
becoming less and less useful for accurate navigation,
primarily because of the upsetting influence exercised upon
it by masses of steel or iron in its neighbourhood. It may
still serve, perhaps, for the surface navigation of submarines,
but for submerged runs the use of a gyro-compass
is all but essential. In warships the weight of
the guns and turrets is now so heavy that the magnetic
compass can hardly remain unaffected by them and is
materially influenced when the guns are trained to
different directions. The shells themselves as they are
discharged are also said to be a cause of error in the
reading of the magnetic compass, for they tend in most
positions of the ship to drag the needle after them by
magnetic attraction as they pass along the bore of the gun.</p>

<p>The value of the gyro-compass is not, however, recognised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
only in the world’s war navies. It is becoming
increasingly appreciated in the mercantile marine, and
there can be but little doubt that the device will soon be
extensively employed on passenger liners and merchantmen
generally. In the following pages we attempt to
give an account of the working of the gyro-compass and
to describe the forms assumed by the device in practice—sufficiently
fully to illustrate the theory without going
into any great detail on the constructional side—and to
do so without depending upon the reader’s possessing
mathematical knowledge.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that it is much easier to treat the
gyroscope and all its practical applications mathematically
than non-mathematically, and that the avoidance
of mathematics generally leads to a discussion of this
essentially mathematical device which is unscientific,
unsound, and of very little practical value. We trust
that our account will be found to avoid these defects and
that it will prove useful and enlightening to those who
have so far failed to understand the behaviour of the
gyroscope and its applications by reason of the fact that
hitherto all trustworthy descriptions have been couched
in a highly mathematical form or have been mere mathematics
thinly disguised in written words. It is admittedly
not easy to understand gyroscopic phenomena either
with or without the aid of mathematics, but on the other
hand many of the difficulties of the subject are largely
artificial. Thus the mathematician, when dealing with
it, seems to be much more concerned with his equations
than in creating a mental picture of what they represent;
yet every one of his equations can be or should be capable
of being represented physically. Those who set out to
avoid mathematics do not usually succeed in giving a
discussion sufficiently complete to be of any practical
service afterwards to their readers. Thus in dealing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
the gyro-compass the so-called “popular” description
in most cases begins and ends with an explanation of
why the device possesses directive force when it is set up
at the equator. It is quite easy to demonstrate the
existence of such force at the equator. It is not so easy
to show non-mathematically how the directive force is
generated and applied when the compass is situated north
or south of the equator. The necessity for damping the
horizontal vibrations of the gyro-axle and how the
required damping force is applied in practice are still
more difficult to explain, while the errors to which the
gyro-compass is open—such as the latitude and the
quadrantal errors—are even more trying to make clear.
The latter subjects are usually neglected in the “popular”
account of the compass. Yet without some means of
damping the vibrations referred to or of eliminating or
allowing for the various errors, the compass, even though
it can be shown to possess directive force in all latitudes,
would be utterly useless—especially on board ship—as
a direction indicator.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be remarked that while the gyro-compass
represents to-day probably the most intricate
and involved practical application of the gyroscope, it
is not the only one of importance. This fact is to our
advantage, for if we succeed in explaining the theory and
working of the gyro-compass we shall have succeeded in
placing the reader in a position enabling him readily to
understand all other devices in which a gyroscope is
employed or in which gyroscopic phenomena are developed.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Let</span> a wheel A (<a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a>) be mounted on an axle B C journalled
within a horizontal ring D. Let this ring in turn
be mounted on journals E F within a vertical ring G and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
further, let this vertical ring be carried on journals H J
within a vertical frame K. This arrangement constitutes
a gyroscopic system having three degrees of freedom,
because relatively to the frame K the wheel may turn
about three axes B C, E F, and H J mutually at right
angles to each other and because, if the wheel is set spinning
on its axle, gyroscopic properties will be manifested.</p>

<div id="ip_1" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25.25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p004.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 1.</span> Model Gyroscope, with Three Degrees of Freedom.</div></div>

<p>The following is a brief statement of the gyroscopic
properties manifested when the wheel is spun on its axle:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Let the wheel be spinning in the direction of the
arrow L and let a weight W be hung on the horizontal
ring at the end B of the axle. The movement produced
by this weight is not a rotation of the horizontal ring, and
the wheel within it, about the axis E F. Instead, the
horizontal ring remains horizontal and the whole system
inside the square frame sets off rotating at a uniform
speed about the axis H J in the direction of the arrow
marked M on the horizontal ring. This rotation or precession,
as it is called, will be maintained so long as the
weight W remains in action. There is here no question of
perpetual motion. The work expended in overcoming
the friction at the vertical journals is derived from the
energy of the spinning wheel, and when this energy is
exhausted the phenomenon ceases. The phenomenon
can, in fact, only be maintained indefinitely by expending
power to drive the wheel against the leakage of energy
through friction at the journals of the axle and the vertical
axis H J. A closer examination of the phenomenon
would show that there is a slight rocking motion of the
horizontal ring on its axis E F, and therefore an additional
leakage of energy at the journals of this axis. This rocking
motion can be neglected for our present purposes. It is
sufficiently accurate to say that the horizontal ring
remains horizontal.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The speed of the precession is proportional to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
weight W and to the speed of rotation of the wheel on its
axle. For instance, doubling the weight doubles the
speed of precession.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If the direction of spin of the wheel is reversed the
direction of the precession is also reversed.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) If the spin of the wheel is in the direction L, and if
instead of attaching a weight at the end B of the axle we
exert an <em>upward</em> force at this point the precession developed
will be <em>opposed</em> to the direction of the arrow M.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) If instead of trying to rotate the wheel about the
axis E F by means of a weight or force applied at B we
attempt to turn it about the vertical axis H J by applying
a horizontal force V to the outer ring, the wheel will not
turn about the vertical axis H J, but about the horizontal
axis E F, the end B of the axle rising up towards H.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) As before, the direction of this movement is reversed
by reversing either the direction of spin of the wheel or
action of the force V. If both are reversed simultaneously
the direction of the movement produced by the applied
force is not altered.</p>

<p>The behaviour set forth above can be summarised in a
general rule as follows:—If to a spinning wheel possessing
three degrees of freedom a force be applied tending to
turn the wheel about some axis X X, the actual motion
produced will not be about X X but about some other
axis Y Y; this axis Y Y will be such that rotation about
it will tend to bring the axle of the spinning wheel into
coincidence with or parallel with the axis X X; the
direction of the rotation produced about Y Y will be such
that when the condition of coincidence or parallelism
is reached the spin of the wheel will coincide in direction
with the rotation we are attempting to produce about
the axis X X.</p>

<p>Taking case (<i>a</i>) (<a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a>), it will be seen that the axis E F
about which we are attempting to produce rotation by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
means of the weight W, together with the weight W
itself, is of necessity carried round by the precession in
the direction M at the same rate as the axle of the spinning
wheel. The axle in this case cannot therefore place
itself in coincidence with the axis of the applied force.
But it does its best to do so. The precession persists and
is an expression of the fruitless chase of the axis E F by
the axle B C.</p>

<div id="ip_2" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_p007.jpg" width="412" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 2.</span> Model Gyroscope, with Three Degrees of Freedom.</div></div>

<p>If, however, the weight is attached by some kind of
sliding connection on the horizontal ring in such a way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
that its line of action remains stationary in space, then
the axis about which we are attempting to produce
rotation will also remain stationary in the position occupied
by the axis E F before precession commences. In
this case it is quite possible for the axle of the wheel to
place itself in coincidence with the axis of the applied force.
Precession about H J through 90 deg. will accomplish
this result, as indicated in <a href="#ip_2">Fig. 2</a>. The weight W is now
acting at a point on the horizontal ring where it ceases to
have any tendency to turn the wheel about the axis E F.
When, therefore, the position of coincidence is reached
precession ceases and the system comes to rest in this
position.</p>

<p>If the experiment were actually made it would be
found that the momentum acquired by the system during
the 90 deg. turn would carry the axle through the position
of coincidence with the axis of the applied force. But
immediately the axle passes to the opposite side the force
W is exerted on a point of the horizontal ring between
F and C. The action of the force passing on to this, the
opposite, segment of the ring reverses the conditions
under which the system started its movement and as a
result precession in the direction opposed to the arrow M
is set up. The axle thus tends to recover its position of
coincidence and in the end settles down to a vibratory
motion from side to side of the axis of the applied weight.
Friction at the vertical journals will “damp” this
vibratory motion, the amplitudes of the swings will
decrease, and the axle will ultimately settle in steady
coincidence with the axis of the applied force. In this
condition the force will have no further effect on the
system beyond throwing a bending moment on to the
vertical axis.</p>

<div id="ip_3" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 3.</span> Frictional Transmission of Turning Moment.</div></div>

<p>Instead of trying to make the wheel rotate about the
axis E F by applying a weight to the inner ring as in
<a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a>, let us, as shown in <a href="#ip_3">Fig. 3</a>, mount the square frame
K on a horizontal axis N P and attach the weight W to
an arm fixed on the frame. The axes N P and E F being—at
least initially—collinear, the effect of this arrangement
is to throw a turning moment on to the wheel
about the axis E F just as does the weight W in <a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a>.
It is to be noticed, however, that the moment of the
weight W in <a href="#ip_3">Fig. 3</a> about the axis N P is transmitted to
the inner ring as a moment about the axis E F solely
because of the friction existing at the journals of the
axis E F. This friction may be very small, so that the
turning moment received by the wheel is only a very small
fraction of the turning moment exerted by the weight
W about N P. The effect of the arrangement is thus
exactly the same as would be produced in the arrangement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
<a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a> if we reduced the weight W to a hundredth
or a thousandth of its value. In other words, precession
about the vertical axis H J will set in in the direction of
the arrow M just as before, but the speed of this precession
will be only a hundredth or a thousandth of the
previous value.</p>

<p>It is not very important to trace out the behaviour of
the system shown in <a href="#ip_3">Fig. 3</a> beyond a very brief period
immediately after the weight W is applied. The point
of importance is that the precession produced by the
weight is very slow, and therefore that in a given interval
of time the amount precessed is very small. Further, the
rate of the precession depends solely upon the friction at
the journals of the axis E F and not upon the weight W
or the movement of the frame K except in so far as these
factors affect the friction. The less the friction the less
will be the rate of precession and the amount precessed
in a given time. Thus by mounting the axis E F on
knife edges the friction can be made so small that the
precession produced by the weight W becomes immeasurable.
Hence we deduce that if friction is substantially
absent at the axis E F the frame K might be violently
rocked on the axis N P or even set into continuous
rotation without causing the axle of the wheel either to
dip or to precess.</p>

<p>Continuing the argument, we might mount the square
frame on a vertical axis and attempt to produce rotation
of the wheel about the axis H J by applying a
horizontal force to one side of the square frame instead
of a force V on the outer ring as shown in <a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a>. A
similar result would be obtained. Granted an all but
total absence of friction at the journals of the vertical
axis H J, the precession produced about the horizontal
axis E F would be immeasurably small. Thus the frame
might be set into violent motion about its vertical axis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
without causing the axle either to rotate in a horizontal
plane or to precess in a vertical one.</p>

<div id="ip_4" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_p011.jpg" width="489" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 4.</span> One Degree of Freedom Lost.</div></div>

<p>Finally, if the square frame were mounted on a horizontal
axis collinear with the axle B C it might obviously
be rotated about this axis without affecting the system
otherwise than by increasing or reducing the rubbing
speed of the axle B C in its bearings.</p>

<p>Since pure translation of the frame in any direction
cannot apply a turning moment to the system about any
axis, and as rotation of the frame about any one of the
three principal axes has no effect which is measurable
on the orientation of the axle, it follows that, given substantial
absence of friction at the axes E F and H J,
the axle of the wheel will remain constantly pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
parallel with its original position, no matter how the frame
K may be moved or turned about.</p>

<div id="ip_5" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 31.8125em;">
  <img src="images/i_p012.jpg" width="509" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 5.</span> Second Degree of Freedom Lost.</div></div>

<p>The gyroscopic system shown in <a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a> has, as we have
said, “three degrees of freedom,” because its wheel is free
to spin about three different axes mutually at right angles.
It is to be carefully noted that it can only truly be said
to have three degrees of freedom so long as the inner ring
and the parts inside it are not rotated on the axis E F
away from the position which in <a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a> they are shown as
occupying relatively to the outer ring. Thus rotation of
the wheel on its axle or of the whole system inside the
square frame on the axis H J leaves the three axes B C,
E F, H J undisturbed at right angles to each other.
But rotation of the inner ring and the parts inside it on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
the axis E F tends to destroy one of the degrees of freedom.
If, for instance, the inner ring is rotated through 90 deg.,
as shown in <a href="#ip_4">Fig. 4</a>, the axle B C and the axis H J will
coincide in direction. In this position the wheel cannot
be rotated about a horizontal axis at right angles to E F and
has therefore virtually only two degrees of freedom, namely,
about the axis E F and about the axis H B C J. Again,
if with the inner ring in the position shown in <a href="#ip_4">Fig. 4</a>
the outer ring is turned through 90 deg. relatively to the
square frame, the system assumes the configuration
shown in <a href="#ip_5">Fig. 5</a> and the wheel loses the power of rotating
about a horizontal axis in the plane of the square frame.</p>

<div id="ip_6" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 33.375em;">
  <img src="images/i_p013.jpg" width="534" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 6.</span> Lost Degrees of Freedom Restored.</div></div>

<p>If, then, in any application of the gyroscope it is
necessary to guarantee that the system shall have three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
degrees of freedom in all possible configurations, the simple
mounting shown in <a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a> will not serve the purpose.
It can be made to do so in the manner shown in <a href="#ip_6">Fig. 6</a>,
namely, by mounting the square frame inside a gimbal
ring X, which in turn is supported by a frame Y, the
two new axes T U and V W being at right angles to each
other. In the position shown in <a href="#ip_4">Fig. 4</a> the new axis
T U would restore the lost third degree of freedom, while
the second new axis V W would restore the degree of
freedom lost when the system assumed the configuration
shown in <a href="#ip_5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>In the gyro-compass it is necessary to guarantee that
the spinning wheel in all possible configurations shall have
three degrees of freedom, and accordingly we find the wheel
mounted in a manner reproducing the features of <a href="#ip_6">Fig. 6</a>.
On the other hand, the majority of the movements which
the compass system is called upon to make do not entail
anything except very small degrees of rotation of the
inner ring and wheel about the axis E F (<a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a>), and
therefore for most purposes the simple mounting there
shown reproduces the required three degrees of freedom
sufficiently closely to permit us to use it for demonstration
purposes. In one very important portion of our subsequent
discussion, however—namely, that dealing with
the effect on a marine gyro-compass produced by rolling
and pitching of the vessel—it will be necessary for us to
take cognisance of the fact that the square frame shown
in <a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a> is not fixed directly to the ship’s deck, but is
really carried in gimbals as shown in <a href="#ip_6">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GYROSCOPE AND THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Let</span> us now suppose that the gyroscopic system shown
in <a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a>—without the weight W—is placed on the equator
as represented at P (<a href="#ip_7">Fig. 7</a>), and that the axle is set pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
due east and west as at B C. At the end of an interval
of time, say two hours, the earth will have rotated through
some angle α, say 30 deg., and will have carried the
gyroscope with it to the position Q. The square frame
has thus clearly been inclined relatively to its original
position. It has, in fact, suffered the exact equivalent
of a direct translation R together with a pure rotation
about a horizontal axis through E of amount α. The
translation leaves the system unaffected, but the rotation
of the frame results in the frame moving relatively to the
axle, wheel, and inner ring. The axle, in fact, remains
parallel with its original position at P. It is still pointing
east and west, but the frame is now inclined to it and,
relatively to the horizontal surface of the earth at Q,
the axle is dipping at an angle β which is equal to α—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>or
30 deg. Actually, if we fixed a disc to the square
frame and a hand to the inner ring, as indicated in Fig.
8, the system as erected at the equator would form a
twenty-four hour clock indicating strictly accurate
sidereal time as distinct from mean solar time. To an
observer on the earth the hand would appear to travel
clockwise round the disc once in twenty-four hours.
Actually, however, the hand would not rotate, but would
remain constantly parallel with its original position,
while the disc would travel anti-clockwise relatively to
the hand and would make one complete turn in twenty-four
hours. The hand would remain parallel with its
original position by virtue of the fact already stated,
namely, that the force applied to the inner ring through
its all-but-frictionless supports is very small, and in any
event does not turn the hand clockwise, but causes the
wheel, inner ring, and hand to precess about the
vertical axis H J. The rate at which this precession
took place would be a measure of the success with
which we had eliminated friction at the horizontal
axis E F.</p>

<p>It might be thought that the system would without
further addition serve as a compass, for if it maintains
its axle constantly pointing in one direction it is just as
good as a compass which always points its needle towards
the magnetic north. In the magnetic compass, however,
the needle has a directive force applied to it which enables
it to recover its standard direction if it should be accidentally
deflected from it. In the gyroscopic system we have
been considering there is no such directive force. The
axle will remain pointing in one direction, it is true, but
the system is indifferent as to what that direction may be.
If the axle is accidentally deflected it will remain pointing
in the new direction as consistently as it did before in
the originally set direction. As a substitute for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
ordinary compass, then, the success of the device would
depend upon the success with which accidental deflecting
forces were prevented from acting on the axle after it
had been set in a known direction. In practice, as Dr.
Anschütz found in his early investigations, it is excessively
difficult, if not quite impossible, to construct a gyroscopic
system in which the centre of gravity and the centre of
suspension are absolutely coincident. As a result a very
minute gravity torque is thrown on the system, and in
consequence the axle very slowly precesses away from
the original set direction. This fact and the complication
of parts required to give practical effect to the idea led
Dr. Anschütz to abandon his early attempts at providing
a compass substitute of the apparently simple nature
described above.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 9.</span> Elementary Gyro-Compass.</div></div>

<p>An addition to the system of a very simple kind in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
itself not only endows the axle with directive force, but
makes the direction which it seeks the north and south
one, and thus converts the system into a device possessing
the familiar property of the compass. This addition
consists of a pendulum-like weight S (<a href="#ip_9">Fig. 9</a>), attached
below the wheel by a stirrup fixed to the inner ring so
that the weight, stirrup, inner ring, axle, and wheel may
swing as a whole on the horizontal axis E F.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the system with this addition is
set up at the equator and that the axle this time is aligned
at right angles to the equator so that the end B, as shown
at I (<a href="#ip_10">Fig. 10</a>), points due north. In this condition the
inner ring is horizontal and the weight S is vertically
below the pendulum axis E F. No turning moment is
therefore being applied by gravity to the wheel. If
through imperfection of workmanship the centre of
suspension of the system is not absolutely coincident
with the centre of gravity before the weight S and its
stirrup are attached, then the minute gravity torque
arising from the lack of coincidence will be balanced
automatically by the weight, the inner ring taking up
some position minutely inclined to the horizontal. There
will thus under all conditions be no resultant turning
moment applied by gravity to the system as thus set up.
In addition, the axle, lying north and south as it does,
is aligned parallel with the earth’s polar diameter. Consequently
the rotation of the earth can only move it
parallel with its original position, and therefore does not
tend to cause relative motion between it and the square
frame. We conclude, then, that in this north and south
position of the axle the system is not acted upon by any
force or influence tending to cause the axle to depart
from the north and south position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<div id="ip_10" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p020.jpg" width="432" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 10.</span> Elementary Compass at Equator.</div></div>

<p>Now let us suppose that the axle by some agency is
forced into parallelism with the equator so that the end
B points due east as indicated at II (<a href="#ip_10">Fig. 10</a>). Immediately
after it takes up this position the tendency of the
axle to remain parallel with this, its new original, direction
becomes manifested in attempted relative motion between
the axle, wheel, and inner ring on the one hand and the
square frame on the other. Thus as the earth rotates
the axle, etc., tend to set themselves relatively to the
frame in the position shown at III. In this position,
however, the weight S being rigidly suspended from the
inner ring, is no longer vertically below the pendulum
axis E F. Gravity acting upon the weight therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
applies a turning force to the wheel, etc., about the axis
E F. The system is thus under the same conditions as
those represented in <a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a>, when the weight W is hung on
the inner ring at B. Precession about the vertical axis
therefore sets in, in the direction M (<a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a>), so that the
end B of the axle swings round from the east towards
the north.</p>

<p>Let us reset the system in position I, and then by
some agency cause the axle again to align itself parallel
with the equator, this time, however, with the end B
pointing due west as shown at IV (<a href="#ip_10">Fig. 10</a>). As before,
the rotation of the earth combined with the tendency
of the axle to remain parallel with the new west and east
position results in attempted relative motion between
the axle, etc., and the square frame, so that in a little time
the system would adopt the configuration shown at V.
In this configuration, however, gravity as before applies
through the weight S a turning force about the pendulum
axis E F. Now, comparing the two configurations III
and V, it will be seen that, mere reference letters or
similar distinguishing marks being washed out, they are
indistinguishable except for one fact: the wheel is
rotating in opposite directions. If with the system as
arranged in <a href="#ip_1">Fig. 1</a> we reverse the direction of spin of the
wheel without reversing the direction of the applied force
W, then, as we know already, the direction of the precession
will be reversed. Precession about the vertical
axis will take place in the direction opposed to the arrow
M. Hence in the configuration shown at V (<a href="#ip_10">Fig. 10</a>), the
precession induced by the action of gravity on the weight
S causes the end B of the axle to swing up from due west
towards the north.</p>

<p>We are thus led to identify the end B of the axle as
the north-seeking end and the end C as the south-seeking.
With B pointing due north as at I, there is no force acting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
on the system tending to make the axle depart from the
north and south direction. If B is swung over to the east
or west—or intermediately, as may be taken for granted—a
force is called into play tending to move the end B
back towards the north. It follows, therefore, that the
resting position of the axle is the north and south one
with the end B pointing north.</p>

<p>It may be said, perhaps, that we have neglected to
discuss what happens if from the position I the wheel is
turned by some agency right round until the end B of
the axle points due south. In this condition there is no
resultant gravity torque on the pendulum axis, and the
axle is lying parallel with the earth’s polar axis, so that
the rotation of the earth does not cause relative motion
between the wheel, etc., and the frame. Just as in the
original configuration I, there is thus in this condition
no force applied to the system tending to make the end
B swing away from the pole. But as the reader may
readily establish for himself by reversing the arrows and
reference letters in the five diagrams of <a href="#ip_10">Fig. 10</a>, the
slightest departure of the end B of the axle from the
south-pointing direction towards either side of the
meridian will call into play a force which will cause the
end B to precess up towards the <em>north</em>. With the wheel
spinning in the direction we have shown throughout
our illustrations the only <em>stable</em> position of equilibrium
for the axle is the north and south with the end B pointing
north. It may be pointed out that the magnetic needle
can, like the gyro-compass axle, assume a position of
unstable equilibrium with the north-seeking end pointing
south.</p>

<p>A point of very great practical importance into which
to inquire is the magnitude of the directive force, the
existence of which, when the axle is deflected from the
north and south position, we have just demonstrated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
This directive force or restoring moment, as will have
been gathered from our explanation, increases with the
deflection from the north, being a maximum when the
axle is lying east and west or west and east. Its magnitude
in any position of the axle depends upon (<i>a</i>) the speed
of rotation of the earth on its polar axis, (<i>b</i>) the speed of
the spinning wheel on its axle, and (<i>c</i>) the mass, or, more
correctly, the moment of inertia, of the wheel. The
first item is small—0.0007 of a revolution per minute—and
is quite beyond our control. The second factor is
consequently made as large as possible, while the third
is also made large, but a limit is placed to our choice by
questions of safety and temperature rise at the high
speeds adopted for the spin of the wheel. In the following
table we give the values of these factors for three
of the types of gyro-compass to be described later.</p>

  <img src="images/i_p024.jpg" width="440" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 11.</span> Elementary Compass at 55 deg. N. Lat.</div></div>

<p>We have now to explain how the gyro-pendulum
system manifests its compass-like property when it is
transferred from the equator to some degree of latitude
north or south. In <a href="#ip_11">Fig. 11</a> we represent the system
as set up in the latitude of the British Isles. The axle
is horizontal and the end B is pointing due east. In
this configuration the earth’s rotation is, through the
action of gravity on the pendulum bob S, trying to make
the wheel turn round the earth’s polar axis once every
twenty-four hours. As before, in accordance with the
fundamental property of the gyroscope, the wheel will
try to set its axle into coincidence with or parallel with
the axis about which it is being forced to rotate. In other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
words, the wheel will endeavour to turn in such a way as
to align its axle along V U with the end B towards U.
This movement can be effected by a rotation about the
vertical axis H J through a right angle combined with
a rotation about the horizontal axis E F through an
angle θ equal to the latitude of the station at which the
system is set up. The rotation about the vertical axis
H J does not result in deflecting the weight S away from
the plumb line, and therefore can be completely fulfilled.
The rotation about the horizontal axis does, however,
affect the bob. The axle, having executed the horizontal
portion of its movement, is pointing its end B due north,
but this end, unlike its behaviour at the equator, manifests
a desire to rise vertically so as to align the axle along
V U. Its desire to do so is resisted by the bob S, and the
axle therefore fails to complete the full movement.</p>

<p>The axle is thus held substantially horizontal with
its end B pointing to the north. As the earth rotates
the desire of the axle to align itself parallel with the
polar axis persists. In attempting continuously to
fulfil this desire it acquires a slight upward tilt, which
is sufficient to bring the pendulum weight into action.
With the weight thus slightly deflected towards the
north a moment is applied to the wheel which tends
to turn the wheel about the horizontal axis E F in
such a way as to bring the end B down again to the
horizontal plane. Such a moment, as we know from
the fundamental rule of the gyroscope, will actually
produce precession about the vertical axis H J, the
direction of this precession being such as to cause the
end B to move away from the north towards the <em>west</em>.</p>

<p>The fact, then, that the axle is prevented from aligning
itself completely parallel with the earth’s polar axis thus
apparently results, once it has found the north, in making
it wander, in northern latitudes, towards the west. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
is not so. Once the axle has <em>found</em> the north a steady
uniform precession towards the west is required to <em>maintain</em>
it on the north. Thus in <a href="#ip_12">Fig. 12</a> let A be the wheel
and axle of the compass when it finds the north. If the
axle maintained this alignment then some time later it
would assume the position shown dotted at D; that is to
say, it would be pointing towards east of north. To
maintain it on the north it must rotate westwardly
through the angle ϕ in the interval between A and D. As
this angle ϕ grows with the interval the required rotation
is really equivalent to a steady uniform precession
towards the west.</p>

<div id="ip_12" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p026.jpg" width="600" height="500" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 12.</span> Compass at Equator and near North Pole.</div></div>

<p>If the compass in <a href="#ip_12">Fig. 12</a> is practically at the north
pole it is clear that to hold the end B of the axle on the
north the axle has to precess about the vertical axis H J
of the compass mounting at the rate of practically one
complete revolution per twenty-four hours—that is,
0.0007 revolution per minute. At the equator the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
required rate of precession about H J is zero, for any
movement about this axis will carry the axle away from
the north. At intermediate latitudes the precession
required to hold the axle on the north has an intermediate
value. Its value for any latitude θ is, in fact, 0.0007 × sin
θ in revolutions per minute.</p>

<p>Thus as the latitude is changed the required rate of
precession also changes. So, too, does the angle θ
(<a href="#ip_11">Fig. 11</a>), by which the axle fails to reach parallelism
with the earth’s polar axis, and consequently so does
the strength with which the axle desires to reach this
alignment. As the equator is left farther and farther
behind, then, the axle comes to rest pointing north
with a greater and greater upward tilt from the horizontal.
The applied moment of the weight S thus
increases. It increases just at the rate necessary to give
the required rate of westerly precession for the particular
latitude in which the compass is at any moment stationed.
Should anything prevent the axle from acquiring the tilt
appropriate to the latitude, or should the westerly
precession on the vertical axis caused by this tilt be
opposed and reduced in any way, the axle will fail to
keep on the north and will lag behind the meridian with
an easterly deviation. We shall see later on that the
precession about the vertical axis is in some designs of
gyro-compass unavoidably opposed, and that as a consequence
these compasses exhibit a latitude error.</p>

<p>We have thus shown that the effort of the compass
to set its axle parallel with the earth’s polar axis, combined
with the action of gravity on the pendulum weight,
is necessary to the compass if the axle once having found
the north is to remain on it, and that this effort of the
axle increases in strength the farther north—or south—the
compass is moved from the equator. What, however,
this effort gains in strength as the angle of latitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
increases the effective directive force on the compass
loses. Thus in <a href="#ip_11">Fig. 11</a> the directive force may be
represented as at <i>f</i> by a line parallel with the earth’s
polar axis. This line represents the magnitude of the
compass’s effort to set its axle parallel with the polar axis.
The speed of the spinning wheel and its moment of inertia
have not been altered by moving the compass away from
the equator, nor has the angular speed of the compass
round the earth’s axis, for although the compass is
moving in a circle of reduced radius T B, and therefore is
travelling with less linear velocity than at the equator,
it is still making one turn per twenty-four hours round the
polar axis of the earth. Thus the three factors fixing the
magnitude of the “directive force” are unaltered. The
force <i>f</i> is thus the same as that exerted on the compass at
the equator. It does not, however, act as before, purely
about the vertical axis H J, but partly about H J and
partly about the horizontal axis E F. It may be regarded
as a force applied at the end B of the axle and therefore
as tending to turn the wheel about an imaginary axis <i>a b</i>.
We may resolve it into two components <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>, <i>p</i> being
at right angles to the axis H J and <i>q</i> at right angles to
E F. The component <i>q</i> represents the magnitude of the
upwardly tilting effect applied to the axle by the rotation
of the earth. The component <i>p</i> represents the effective
directive force tending to restore the axle from the
deflected position represented towards the north in the
horizontal plane. The angle between this effective
component and the full force <i>f</i> is θ, the angle of latitude
of the station at which the compass is set up. The
effective directive force is thus <i>f</i> cos θ, and therefore
diminishes from the value <i>f</i> at the equator towards zero
as the north—or south—pole is approached.</p>

<span class="subhead">DAMPING THE VIBRATIONS OF THE GYRO-COMPASS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Reviewing</span> what we have already established, we see
that a gyroscopic system possessing “three degrees of
freedom” and having a pendulum weight fixed below
the wheel manifests a tendency in all latitudes to
preserve its axle pointing in the north and south direction,
a “directive force” or restoring moment being developed
and applied to the axle if the north and south position is
departed from. The magnitude of the directive force in
any given latitude increases with the deflection, from
zero when the axle is pointing north and south up to a
maximum when it is aligned east and west. At any given
angle of deflection of the axle the magnitude of the
directive force varies with the latitude in which the
system is stationed, being zero at the north or south
(true) pole and a maximum at the equator. Finally, at
any given angle of deflection of the axle and in any given
latitude the magnitude of the directive force is determined
by (<i>a</i>) the speed of rotation of the earth on its polar axis,
(<i>b</i>) the speed of rotation of the spinning wheel on its axle,
and (<i>c</i>) the mass or moment of inertia of the spinning
wheel.</p>

<p>We have now to consider several important matters
affecting the practical application of the gyroscope-pendulum
combination as a substitute for the magnetic
compass. The first practical consideration which arises
naturally in our minds is the question: Can a system be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
devised and constructed sufficiently robust to withstand
the trials and knocks of every-day use and yet be sufficiently
delicate to respond to the feeble directive forces
on the effect of which its action as a compass depends?
From the table given previously it will have been noted
that in the three chief types of gyro-compass so far
developed the directive forces developed are in two
examples greater than the corresponding directive force
applied to the card of a magnetic compass, while in the
third the directive force is materially lower. Even
though they were all considerably greater than the force
applied to the needle of a magnetic compass, some doubt
as to their sufficiency to effect their work would remain,
for they have to control sensitive elements, comprising
a spinning wheel, axle, supporting rings, etc., weighing
anything from 7 lb. to about a hundredweight, whereas
in the ordinary compass the sensitive element consisting
of the card and its attached magnetic needles weighs
round about ¼ oz. The actual weights of the sensitive
elements are given in the following table.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>Weight of Sensitive Element.</i></p>

<p>Whether or not the directive force developed will be
sufficient to control the movement of the sensitive
element in a gyro-compass must clearly depend very
largely upon the degree of success reached in banishing
friction from the vertical axis about which the sensitive
element moves. Without for the present describing the
means actually adopted to secure virtually frictionless
support in the three types of gyro-compass, we may say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
that were they other than very refined no compass action
whatever would be manifested. In the early theoretical
days of the gyro-compass before sufficiently refined
practical constructive methods had been developed, the
experimental verification of the mathematical results
arrived at could not be attempted.</p>

<p>Granted the attainment in practice of a satisfactory
frictionless method of supporting the sensitive element,
we have next to note that the simple gyro-pendulum
system which we have been considering would be quite
useless as a direction-finding device either at sea or on
land by virtue of the fact that the very absence of
friction at the vertical axis would encourage the sensitive
element to oscillate from side to side of the meridian
under the least provocation. The period of oscillation
would be a prolonged one, much too prolonged, in fact, to
permit the true north to be determined by taking the
mean of the extreme positions reached by the gyro-axle
in the course of its oscillation.</p>

<p>We have seen that the simple gyro-pendulum system
which we have so far been considering, when placed on
the equator, manifests a tendency to set its axle north
and south, that if the axle is deflected towards the east
a westerly turning directive force is developed, and that
if the axle is deflected towards the west an easterly
turning directive force is developed.</p>

<p>In an ordinary vertical pendulum (<a href="#ip_13">Fig. 13</a>), the resting
position of the bob is at <i>d</i>. If it is swung to the position <i>e</i>—towards
the east, let us say—the weight <i>w</i> of the bob
supplies a moment about the axis at <i>g</i>, tending to restore
the pendulum to its resting position; while if it is swung
towards the position <i>f</i>—towards the west, we may
suppose—the moment is reversed and again acts to
restore the pendulum to its resting position.</p>

<p>The gyro-pendulum system as set up at the equator
is, it will be seen, subjected to an exactly analogous set
of forces when its axle is deflected east or west. The
system, in fact, constitutes virtually a horizontal
pendulum, the vertical axis H J being identified with the
axis at <i>g</i> in the ordinary pendulum. Now we know that
if we deflect an ordinary pendulum to some such position
as <i>e</i> and let it go it will swing through the resting position
<i>d</i> to a position <i>f</i> equidistant on the other side, and will
continue to vibrate until friction at the axis <i>g</i>, air resistance,
etc., sap its original stock of energy communicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
to it by the initial deflection. The period of vibration—the
time elapsing between two successive passages of the
bob in the same direction through the resting position—is
determined by the length of the pendulum and remains
constant throughout, even when the amplitude of the
swing has fallen off virtually to nothing.</p>

<p>An exactly analogous state of affairs exists with the
gyro-pendulum system. If the axle is deflected towards
the east and then let go it will swing back under the
action of the directive or restoring force through the
north and south position over to an equal angle on the
western side, and will thereafter vibrate back and forth
with a constant period, until frictional and other losses
cause the motion to die away. The period of vibration is
determined by a complication of factors, among which
are the speed at which the wheel is spinning on its axle,
the speed of rotation of the earth, and the mass of the
sensitive element. If the sensitive element can be
regarded as consisting solely of the wheel, then, no matter
what may be the size of the wheel, so long as it is in the
form of a circular disc, the period of vibration is determined
solely by the speed of the wheel and the speed of
rotation of the earth. For a wheel at the equator running
at 20,000 revolutions per minute the period of vibration
would be about eleven seconds. In practice, however, the
weight of the axle, the inner and outer supporting rings—or
their equivalents—the pendulum bob and various
other fittings and adjuncts of a secondary nature have
to be added to the weight of the wheel in assessing the
influence of the sensitive element upon the period of
vibration. The greater the mass—or more correctly, the
moment of inertia—of the sensitive element the longer
will be the period of vibration. In the early—1910—Anschütz
gyro-compass the sensitive element had a
moment of inertia such that the period of vibration at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the equator was just over 61 minutes; that is to say, 334
times as long as it would have been if the sensitive
element had consisted of nothing but the spinning wheel.</p>

<p>This very prolonged period, were nothing done to
rectify matters, would be a very serious objection in
practice to the use of the gyro-compass. The axle, if
deflected, would take about half an hour to reach an
equal position on the opposite side of the meridian.
Hence, if, when a compass reading was desired, the axle
were found to be vibrating, at least half an hour would be
required to determine the north and south direction by
observing the two extreme positions of the axle and
taking the mean. The alternative would be to wait until
the vibration died away. This course would involve,
however, a very much greater delay, for the virtual
absence of friction at the vertical axis of the system—an
essential, as we have seen, if the directive force is to be
allowed to come into play at all—results in the vibration
being practically unchecked, so that, once started, it
would continue almost indefinitely.</p>

<p>Some means of damping the vibration analogous to the
damping action of the liquid in a magnetic compass must
clearly then be provided. Ideally the means should be
such that if the axle is deflected through any angle it will
return to the north and south position in a “dead-beat”
manner and not swing across the meridian over to the
opposite side. This ideal cannot be realised in practice.</p>

<p>Returning to the simple pendulum illustrated in <a href="#ip_13">Fig. 13</a>
we have to notice that the influence at work causing the
vibration is the weight of the bob acting about the axis
at <i>g</i>. This influence is a maximum when the bob is at the
extreme positions <i>e f</i> and is zero when the bob is at <i>d</i>. On
the other hand, the velocity of the bob is zero at the two
extreme positions <i>e f</i> and is a maximum at <i>d</i>. During the
swing from <i>e</i> to <i>d</i> the vibrating influence is helping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
motion of the bob and the velocity consequently increases.
At <i>d</i> the vibrating influence disappears, while during the
swing from <i>d</i> to <i>f</i> it reappears and this time opposes the
motion of the bob, the velocity of which consequently
becomes less and less. The movement of the bob from
<i>d</i> to <i>f</i> in opposition to the vibrating influence is achieved
by the momentum of the bob arising from the velocity
which it gathers during its swing
from <i>e</i> to <i>d</i>. For the angle <i>d g f</i>
to be equal to the angle <i>d g e</i> the
velocity of the bob as it passes
through the position <i>d</i> must just
be a certain amount, no more and
no less, namely, the velocity which
a body would acquire in falling
from rest at the level of the bob
at <i>e</i> vertically downwards to the
level of the bob at <i>d</i>. If the
velocity of the bob when it swings
through <i>d</i> is greater than this
amount the bob will swing beyond
the position <i>f</i>. If it is less the
bob will fail to reach <i>f</i>.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 14.</span> Damped and Undamped Vibrations.</div></div>

<p>The analogue of the problem to
be solved in connection with the
gyro-compass is to devise some
means that will rob the pendulum
bob on each successive swing of
some percentage of the velocity
with which it passed through the
resting position <i>d</i> during the preceding swing. By so
doing we shall obviously decrease continuously the angle
to which the pendulum swings on each side of the position
<i>d</i>. Thus instead of the swings as traced out on a piece of
paper moving below the bob being as shown at A (<a href="#ip_14">Fig. 14</a>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
they will be of the form represented at B. The amplitudes,
instead of remaining of uniform amount practically
indefinitely, will diminish with each swing until they
become so small as to be invisible. It is to be noted that
theoretically the vibrations cannot be completely suppressed
even after an indefinite number of swings, for if the
velocity at the resting position is at each swing, say,
50 per cent. less than at the previous passage, it will
always be something and never become zero. It will,
however, in quite a small number of swings become so
low that the motion of the pendulum will be practically
undiscernible. Thus with a 50 per cent. decrement the
velocity at the eighth passage of the bob through the
resting position will be less than 1 per cent. of what it was
at the first passage.</p>

<p>It is also to be noted that while the amplitudes are
decreased in the manner indicated the periods of the
swings are not being made less. In an ordinary pendulum
the period, as we have said, depends solely upon the
length and—within quite wide limits at least—remains
the same whatever be the angle to which we originally
deflect the bob. We should therefore expect that if the
swings are “damped” in the way shown at B (<a href="#ip_14">Fig. 14</a>),
the period of each swing would be the same and equal to
that of the undamped swings represented at A. Actually
the period of a damped vibration is always somewhat
greater than that of the same system vibrating freely,
for by robbing the pendulum of some of its velocity
at each swing we are virtually causing the bob to pass
through the resting position with the velocity of a free
swinging pendulum of greater length and therefore of
increased period. The increase in the period of the
damped pendulum over the same pendulum when undamped
is determined by the strength of the damping
means employed, or, in other words, by the percentage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
by which we reduce the velocity at each
swing.</p>

<p>In the early (1910) Anschütz compass the period
of vibration at the equator without damping was, as
we have stated already, about 61 minutes. With its
damping device in action the period of the compass at
the equator became approximately 70 minutes. In later
designs of gyro-compasses the period of the damped
vibration is deliberately made 85 minutes or thereabouts.
A practical advantage—to be explained later—is secured
by adopting this particular value. It is the period which
a simple pendulum would have if its length were equal to
the radius of the earth—4000 miles or so.</p>

<div id="ip_15" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 33.0625em;">
  <img src="images/i_p037.jpg" width="529" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 15.</span> Damped Pendulum.</div></div>

<p>A vibrating pendulum (<a href="#ip_15">Fig. 15</a>) will be satisfactorily
damped if we can apply to the bob in all positions of
its swing a force proportional to the velocity with which
the bob is moving at each given instant and directed
always so as to oppose the motion. At <i>e</i>, the position of
release after deflection, the bob has no velocity; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
damping force should therefore be zero. As it travels
from <i>e</i> to <i>d</i> the bob is gaining velocity; the damping
force should therefore grow from zero to a maximum at <i>d</i>
and be directed at each instant tangentially to the curve of
swing and act from <i>d</i> towards <i>e</i>. During this portion of
its swing the bob is thus robbed of some of its velocity, so
that it fails to rise to the position <i>f</i> and comes to rest at
some point <i>g</i>. In travelling from <i>d</i> to <i>g</i> the velocity of
the bob is decreasing naturally, and is still further
decreased by the damping force which, acting in the same
direction as before, falls from a maximum at <i>d</i> to zero at <i>g</i>.
As it moves from <i>g</i> to <i>d</i> on the return stroke the bob gains
velocity; the damping force should therefore increase
from zero at <i>g</i> to a maximum at <i>d</i>—of a lower value than
the maximum at the same point during the first stroke—and
should be directed along the curve in the reversed
sense, namely, from <i>d</i> towards <i>g</i>. During the swing from
<i>d</i> to <i>h</i> the damping force, still reversed, should decrease
from the second maximum value once more to zero. At
the start of the second swing the damping force should
again act from <i>d</i> towards <i>e</i> and should rise from zero to
a third maximum value at <i>d</i>—less than either the second
or first maximum value, and so on until the amplitude of
the swing is reduced to the required degree. It will be
noticed that in a damped vibration the mean position of
the bob on any one swing is not coincident with the
resting position <i>d</i>, but lies somewhere between the resting
position and the position from which the bob commences
the swing.</p>

<p>With each passage of the bob through the resting
position <i>d</i> the value of the damping force rises to a
maximum, the value of which becomes less and less on
each successive swing. Ultimately, when the bob settles
in the resting position, the maximum value becomes zero.
In other words, the damping force, having completed its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
work by bringing the bob to rest, entirely disappears and
leaves the pendulum exactly in the same condition as it
would be under in the resting position if no damping force
had ever been in action. The pendulum is thus as free as
formerly to respond, in the resting position, to a vibrating
influence, but as soon as it acquires motion the damping
force is again called into existence to a degree directly
dependent on the strength of the vibrating influence, with
the result that the motion is first checked, and then finally
stopped.</p>

<p>The damping force required is, as we have said, one
which at all times is proportional in magnitude to the
velocity of the bob—or what is the same thing, to the
angular velocity of the pendulum as a whole—and which
at all times acts to oppose the motion of the bob. Metallic
friction—say, at the supporting axis of the pendulum—it
would bring the motion to rest sooner or later,
would not provide a satisfactory damping force, for solid
friction is independent of the rubbing velocity, at least at
low speeds such as we are here concerned with. The
damping force provided by it being constant, would not
be automatically adjusted to the velocity of the bob. It
would vanish, it is true, when the bob was at rest, but as
soon as the slightest vibration set in it would spring up to
its full value straight away and would preserve the same
value throughout a large swing as throughout a small one.
In any event the presence of metallic or other solid friction
at the point in the gyro-compass corresponding to the
axis of the pendulum—namely, at the bearings of the
vertical axis H J—cannot be permitted, and must be
eliminated to the utmost possible degree if the directive
force is to be sufficient to control the movement of the
sensitive element.</p>

<p>Fluid friction, on the other hand, would provide a
satisfactory damping force, for fluid friction is proportional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
to the velocity, at least at low speeds. A
pendulum vibrating with its bob in a vessel of water or
the floating card of an ordinary magnetic compass is
satisfactorily damped by fluid friction. In the gyro-compass,
however, the motion to be damped is, as we
have seen, an exceedingly slow one, slower in fact than
the small hand of a watch if the deflection of the axle
from the meridian is initially less than 11½ deg. east or
west. A fluid damping force would be proportionately
low, so that without making the damping elements of
enormous size the force derived would be insignificant
and next to useless for practical purposes. As an illustration
of this statement it may be remarked that in the
early Anschütz compass the sensitive element was
virtually floated in a bowl of mercury. Yet the drag of
the mercury, the velocity of the vibration being so small,
did not measurably reduce the amplitudes of the vibration
during observation extending over several hours. This
example is not quite a good one, however, for the friction
at the surface of a body immersed in mercury would
appear to be not of the fluid description, but of the solid
type.</p>

<p>Solid and fluid friction being thus ruled out, at least as
direct means of providing the required damping force, we
have to find some other method of applying it. It is, or
should be, clear that in whatever way the damping force
is applied it should originate within the sensitive element
itself. If it originates outside, then its transmission to the
sensitive element cannot, in view of the fact that its
origination, growth, and decay are to be controlled by the
motion of the element, be effected in any conceivable way
without the introduction of some material connection
between the element and the outside source of the force.
Such a connection can only be made frictionless if the
outside source moves in exact unison with the sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
element. If it does so move it clearly ceases to be an
outside source and becomes really part of the sensitive
element itself. This consideration suggests generating
and applying the damping force gyroscopically by the
exertion of some suitable action on the spinning wheel
itself.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DAMPING SYSTEM OF THE ANSCHÜTZ (1910) COMPASS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding chapter we demonstrated the necessity
for damping the horizontal oscillatory movement of the
gyro-compass axle and discussed the nature of damped
vibrations in general. We now turn to describe the damping
means provided in each of the practical forms of gyro-compass
so far evolved.</p>

<p>Turning to the early (1910) form of Anschütz compass,
we find that, as shown in the purely diagrammatic sketch
given in <a href="#ip_16">Fig. 16</a>, the spinning wheel is enclosed within a
metallic case formed with tubular journals B C for the
axle, and provided with trunnions E F, whereby it is
supported within the vertical ring, which, as before, is
free to turn on a vertical axis H J. The casing, it will
be seen is, so far as the support of the wheel is concerned,
exactly equivalent to the horizontal inner ring of our
preceding illustrations. In the actual instrument the
method of supporting the casing so as to permit it to turn
about a horizontal and a vertical axis is not in the least
like that shown in our sketch.</p>

<p>The wheel, running at 20,000 revolutions per minute,
although it is quite plain, has a powerful blower-like
action. On one side of the casing an orifice D is formed
for the inlet of air, and on the periphery below an outlet
duct K, directing the air blast tangentially away from
the casing, is provided. The exact value of the pressure
of the blast in the early Anschütz compass is not known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
to us, but in the Brown compass, wherein a similar blast
is developed, the wheel, running at 15,000 revolutions
per minute, gives an air pressure equal to some 3 in. of
water.</p>

<div id="ip_16" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p043.jpg" width="600" height="409" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 16.</span> Air Blast Damping System of Anschütz (1910) Compass.</div></div>

<p>The mouth of the outlet duct K is partially closed by
a plate L fixed at the end of a pendulum arm suspended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
frictionlessly, or practically so, from some convenient
point on the casing, so that when the casing turns on the
vertical axis H J the arm and plate turn with it. The
pendulum arm is carefully balanced in such a way that
when the axle of the spinning wheel is horizontal the
plate L exactly divides the orifice K, leaving equal
passages for the air blast on each side. In this condition
the two passages M N being equal in area, the air blast is
divided by the plate into two streams of equal volume
and momentum, so that if their free discharge is not
influenced by surrounding objects their reactions on the
casing, one on the one side of the vertical axis H J, the
other on the opposite side, will be equal.</p>

<p>Let the compass be deflected until its axle points east
and west, the end B being towards the east. Then, as
we have seen, the tendency of the axle to remain parallel
with its original position, combined with the rotation of
the earth, will cause the axle to assume an inclined
position relatively to the earth’s horizontal surface.
Gravity acting on the pendulous weight S as thus displaced
from the plumb line will, as we know, set up a precession
about the vertical axis H J, so as to cause the end B of
the axle to move towards the north. When, however,
the axle tilts in this manner about the horizontal axis
E F, the pendulum plate L, hanging freely, remains in
the plumb line. Consequently the equal areas M N
become unequal, as at P Q, the larger P being towards
that end of the axle which has tilted upwards, namely,
the north-seeking end B. The reaction on the casing of
the portion of the air blast issuing from P is now greater
than that of the portion emitted through Q. This
inequality results in the application to the sensitive
element of a force acting about the vertical axis H J.
The reaction of a jet of air or water or other fluid being
opposed to the direction in which the jet is issuing, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
force applied to the casing is such as to drive P into the
plane of the paper and to bring Q out of it—that is to say,
to tend to rotate the casing on the vertical axis in the
direction of the arrow R.</p>

<p>The force thus applied clearly tends to oppose the
return of the axle from the east towards the north. On
the other hand, if the axle succeeds in turning round
until the end B points to the west, the rotation of the
earth will result in the axle tilting as before, but with the
end B downwards. Consequently the area M diminishes
and the area N increases, and the reaction applied to the
casing is such as to tend to turn it in the reverse direction
to R. The applied force in this case therefore opposes
the return of the axle from the west towards the north.
The exact manner in which the opposition acts is to be
noted. A force applied to a simple gyroscope, so as to
tend to make it turn about the vertical axis H J in the
direction R (<a href="#ip_16">Fig. 16</a>) will, as was stated in our second
chapter, cause the wheel to precess about the horizontal
axis E F, the end B of the axle going down and the end
C up. If the force about H J is reversed, the movement
produced will be a precession of the wheel on E F such
that the end B of the axle rises and the end C falls. The
opposition between the moment applied to the sensitive
element by the air blast and the moment applied to it by
the directive force is therefore not quite direct. When
the end B of the axle is deflected towards the east a
directive force is called into being by virtue of the tendency
of this end to rise. The air blast reaction about
H J induces precession on the axis E F, causing the end
B to fall. By the amount by which the air blast reaction
succeeds in lowering the end B of the axle, by that amount
will it reduce the normal magnitude of the directive force.
When the axle swings through the meridian towards the
west a reversed directive force is called into play by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
virtue of the tendency of the end B to fall. The opposition
of the air blast reaction arises from the fact that its
tendency now is to make the end B rise. Thus on both
sides of the meridian the opposition of the air blast
reaction is effective because it tends to precess the wheel
on the axis E F in the direction opposed to that in which
the rotation of the earth is trying to tilt the axle. The
tilt moves the pendulous weight S away from the vertical,
so producing the directive force; the air blast reaction
reduces the tilt and so opposes the directive force.</p>

<p>The reaction applied to the sensitive element by the
air blast thus fulfils one requirement of a satisfactory
damping force; its effect at all times is opposed in
direction to the direction in which the axle is moving.
The second requirement is that the magnitude of its
effect should always be proportional to the velocity with
which the axle is moving.</p>

<p>In connection with this second requirement it is assumed
that the momenta of the air jets issuing from the openings
P Q (<a href="#ip_16">Fig. 16</a>) are at all angles of tilt equivalent to the
momentum of a single jet issuing from an imaginary
orifice U situated at some distance <i>d</i> from the axis H J
on the side of the larger opening P, the area of the imaginary
orifice R and the velocity of the air through it being
constant at all angles of tilt. If this assumption is correct,
then the moment about H J applied by the reaction of the
air blast is proportional to the distance <i>d</i>—that is to say,
to the angle of the tilt.</p>

<p>The assumption here made is, we believe, substantially
justified if the angle of tilt is never very great. In actual
practice it is always small. Various considerations,
however, suggest that the reactions of the two jets P Q
are not equivalent strictly to the reaction of a single jet
through an orifice R of constant area. Thus from
geometrical considerations we can show that the sum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of the areas P Q is not equal to the sum of the areas M N.
Again, the total weight of air drawn in per minute
through the orifice D may be constant, and therefore
the total weight of air delivered per minute through
the combined openings P Q may be unaffected by the
tilt. But the ratio in which the total volume divides
itself between the two openings P Q and the velocity
through each certainly vary with the tilt. A peculiar
practical phenomenon also has to be considered in this
connection. In the 1910 form of Anschütz compass the
peripheral speed of the spinning wheel was 500 ft. per
second, or 340 miles an hour. The air friction at this
speed was so very great that after the wheel had been
run a few thousand hours its surface was found to be
noticeably smoother than it was when the wheel left the
grinding machine on which it was finished. As a result
of this polishing effect, we should expect that even though
the speed of the wheel remained perfectly constant, its
blower-like action would decrease somewhat until the
compass had been in use for a certain length of time.
If the blower action does so decrease the magnitude of
the air blast reaction on the sensitive element at any
given angle of tilt must diminish with time. We do not
know whether the diminution would be sufficiently great
to introduce a serious error in the reading of the compass.</p>

<p>Taking the assumption to be correct, at least for small
angles of tilt, we have next to study how the angle of
tilt varies as the axle swings from the east side of the
meridian over to the west and back again.</p>

<p>When the axle is pointed due east the rotation of the
earth, as we have seen, tends to make the end B rise.
If it is pointed due west, the end B tends to fall. If it
is lying dead on the meridian, the earth’s rotation has no
tilting effect at all on the axle. If the axle is pointed in
some direction between due east and due north, the tilting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
effect is less than it would be if it were pointed due east,
but it is in the same direction; the end B tends to rise.
Similarly, in any position in the north-west quadrant the
end B tends to tilt downwards under a tilting influence
which is somewhat less than that experienced in the due
west position. Let, then, the axle be turned to point due
east. The end B begins at once to rise, but immediately
the axle thus leaves the horizontal position it begins
to feel the directive force, and it commences to turn towards
the north. Until it reaches the north the tilting
influence of the earth’s rotation continues so that during
the whole time the axle is swinging through the north-east
quadrant the tilt is increasing and the end B is rising,
higher and higher. When the north direction is reached
the tilting influence vanishes and the end B of the axle
tends to travel horizontally in its elevated position over
into the north-west quadrant under the influence of the
momentum acquired in that direction during its movement
through the north-east quadrant. But on passing
to the west side of the meridian it again comes under the
tilting influence of the earth’s rotation, which this time
tends to make the end B fall. When the axle reaches the
due west position, the tilting influence being equal to
that acting over the north-east quadrant and reversed
in direction, and having acted for the same length of
time, will just have wiped out the elevation of the end B,
and the axle will again be horizontal. On the return
journey through the north-west quadrant the tilting
influence is still reversed, so that on reaching the north
position again the end B is as far below the horizontal
as it was above it on the swing from east to west. Passing
to the east side of the meridian, the tilting action assumes
its former direction, the end B begins to rise, and when
the due east position is reached again the axle is once
more horizontal. The path traced out by the end B<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
during a complete vibration from east to west and back
again is thus in the nature of an ellipse—or, in extreme
cases, a circle—such as that shown at <i>a b c d e</i> in <a href="#ip_17">Fig. 17</a>.</p>

<p>On an east-to-west swing, then, the end B of the axle
in <a href="#ip_16">Fig. 16</a>, if the air blast is out of action, tilts upwards
from zero to a maximum in the mid position and then
again falls to zero. If the air blast is brought into play,
the reaction, being, as we have seen—at least for all
small angles of tilt—proportional to the angle of tilt
of the axle, will correspondingly increase from zero to a
maximum and again fall to zero. On the west-to-east
swing the reaction will similarly rise and fall in the
reversed direction. The unrestrained movement of the
sensitive element under the influence of the directive
force is, as we know, analogous to that of a simple
pendulum, so that the velocity with which the axle moves
is zero in the extreme positions and a maximum in the
mid position. Thus we see that the air blast reaction
not only constantly opposes the movement of the axle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
with the variation in the velocity with which the axle
moves. The air blast reaction therefore completely fulfils
the requirements of a satisfactory damping force. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
it is brought into play the end B of the axle, instead
of vibrating indefinitely in a closed elliptical path <i>a b ... e</i>
(<a href="#ip_17">Fig. 17</a>) moves spirally, as indicated at <i>f g h</i> ..., until
in a relatively short period of time it comes virtually to
rest at <i>m</i> pointing towards the north.</p>

<p>An actual curve taken from an Anschütz (1910) compass
while it was settling down on the meridian after the
gyro-axle had been deflected nearly 45 deg. to one side
is given in <a href="#ip_18">Fig. 18</a>. The crests A B C occur at 70-minute
intervals—the period of vibration of the system when
damped, as we have already stated. The oscillations
are, it will be seen, damped down very effectively,
being entirely eliminated in less than three hours in the
course of the third complete vibration. It follows that
if the wheel of a gyro-compass is started spinning with
the axle pointing elsewhere than due north, several hours
must be allowed to elapse before readings are taken from
the card. During the period of settling down, and especially
during the later portions, the movement of the axle
towards its resting position is extremely slow, and cannot
be detected by direct observation. It can, however, be
inferred from the readings of a spirit level placed on the
card, for, as we have seen, the oscillations are accompanied
by a tilting of the wheel case on its horizontal axis.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DAMPING SYSTEM OF THE SPERRY COMPASS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">In</span> the Sperry gyro-compass the damping system adopted
is mechanically of a very different nature from that used
in the early Anschütz, although the theoretical principle
of action in both cases is the same. The Sperry method
rules out the employment of air or other fluid in any shape
or form as a means of generating, applying, or transmitting
the damping force, the reason being that if air or other
fluid is relied upon, the damping force—or so the Sperry
Company holds—will not act in strict unison with the
oscillations, but will invariably lag behind.</p>

<p>The details of the Sperry method are indicated in a
diagrammatic manner in <a href="#ip_19">Fig. 19</a>. As in the Anschütz compass,
the spinning wheel revolves in a casing which, being
provided with trunnions E F, takes the place of the inner
horizontal supporting ring of our elementary gyroscope.
Since no blowing action is required of the wheel in this
compass the casing, in order to reduce the expenditure of
power required to drive the wheel, is exhausted of air until
a vacuum of not less than 26 in. is registered on a gauge
which forms a permanent fixture on the casing. The
exhaustion is effected by attaching a hand-operated
vacuum pump to a nipple on the casing. The vacuum
produced at one exhaustion remains effective for at
least a month under proper treatment. That it is very
well worth while exhausting the casing, if the general
design of the compass permits it, is shown by the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
that in the 1910 Anschütz compass over 95 per cent.
of the work done by the motor driving the spinning
wheel was spent against windage and air friction.</p>

<div id="ip_19" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.3125em;">
  <img src="images/i_p053.jpg" width="597" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 19.</span> Damping System of Sperry Compass.</div></div>

<p>The outer ring G (<a href="#ip_19">Fig. 19</a>) within which the casing
is carried is, as before, mounted on a vertical axis H J.
A second outer ring K—or “phantom ring,” as it is
called—surrounds the ring G, and is mounted co-axially
with it. While the ring G, as before, moves along with
the wheel and its casing relatively to the square frame
under the influence of the directive force, the ring K is
caused to follow it up in exact agreement by means of a
small electric motor, the pinion of which engages with a
gear wheel L on the upper trunnion, the current to the
motor being automatically controlled by the movement
of the ring G. The compass card may be regarded as
attached directly to the top face of the gear wheel. A
second pinion gearing with the wheel L can be arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
to transmit the reading of the card to any number of
repeater compasses stationed elsewhere.</p>

<p>In all our preceding illustrations we have shown the
pendulous weight S as being attached by a stirrup directly
on to the inner horizontal ring or its equivalent, the wheel
casing, so as to move in rigid connection therewith. In
the early Anschütz compass the design definitely reproduces
this arrangement, but in the Sperry compass
matters are otherwise. The pendulous weight S (<a href="#ip_19">Fig. 19</a>)
is carried on a stirrup, which is forked at each end so as
to span the rings G K, and which is free to swing on pivots
M N fixed on the phantom ring K. The pivots M N are
exactly in line with the pivots E F, and as the phantom
ring K and the ring G always move in unison, the two
sets of pivots remain at all times collinear.</p>

<p>So far the arrangement of parts is exactly similar to
that which would be obtained in our simple gyro-pendulum
system if the stirrup of the pendulous weight were not
fixed rigidly to the inner horizontal ring, but were swung
freely on the pivots E F. It can be brought into complete
identity with the arrangement of our simple system
if the pendulous weight S (<a href="#ip_19">Fig. 19</a>) or “bail,” as it is
called by the makers, be provided with a pin at its mid
point to engage with a hole in the periphery of the casing.
The system, as thus arranged, would merely be a distinctly
complicated mechanical variation of our simple gyro-pendulum
arrangement, and, as a compass, would be
open to the same practical objection, namely, the persistence
with which any oscillation of the axle, once set
up, would continue. The vibrations would, in fact, be
quite undamped.</p>

<p>The generation and application of a satisfactory
damping force is accomplished in a very simple, yet
beautiful and really ingenious, manner by displacing
the pin connecting the bail and the casing from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
mid position to some position lying eastwards of the
vertical axis H J, as shown at Q.</p>

<div id="ip_20" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 29.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_p055.jpg" width="478" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 20.</span> Action of Excentric Pin in Sperry Compass.</div></div>

<p>In order to follow the action of this arrangement,
let us consider a disc (<a href="#ip_20">Fig. 20</a>) swung on a horizontal axis
E F on which there is also swung a weighted stirrup S,
the stirrup and disc being connected by a pin Q. Let
this system of parts be held horizontal, and in the first
instance let the pin, as shown in the upper view, be
arranged on the centre line of the disc. Then the weight
W of the stirrup applies to the disc three forces, namely,
a force W + <i>w</i> acting downwards at the end of the pin,
and two upward forces P equal to each other at the
pivots E F, as will readily be seen by considering the
stirrup as a lever fulcrumed at the disc end of the pin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
The only force tending to turn the disc is the force W + <i>w</i>
acting about the axis E F.</p>

<p>Let, now, the pin be situated excentrically relatively
to the axis H J of the disc, as shown in the lower view.
The forces applied to the disc by the weight W of the
stirrup are again three in number. The force applied
at the end of the pin is, as before, W + <i>w</i>, but at the
pivot E the force applied falls to P - <i>p</i>, while the force
at the pivot F rises to P + <i>p</i>. These forces apply turning
moments to the disc. About the axis E F the turning
moment, as before, is that of the force W + <i>w</i>. This
force, owing to the displacement of the pin, has now, in
addition, a turning moment about the axis H J in the
direction of the arrow R. The upward force P - <i>p</i> on the
pivot E tends to turn the disc in the same direction,
while the force P + <i>p</i> on the pivot F tends to turn it in
the opposed direction. These three turning moments
about the axis H J exactly balance each other, as can
be confirmed by working out their values. Thus there
is no net alteration produced by shifting the pin from its
central position, for in all positions of the pin the only
effective moment applied by the weight W to the disc
is that of the force W + <i>w</i> about the axis E F.</p>

<p>Now, in the Sperry system the forces P - <i>p</i> and
P + <i>p</i> are not allowed to act on the trunnions E F of
the wheel casing, but are borne by the phantom ring K
(<a href="#ip_19">Fig. 19</a>) whence they are transmitted back to form part
of the load on the follow-up motor. Acting on the casing,
therefore, there remains only the force W + <i>w</i>. This
force exerts a turning moment about the axis E F strictly
equal to that produced by a directly attached pendulous
weight. In addition, it exerts a turning moment about the
axis H J.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 21.</span> Action of Excentric Pin in Sperry Compass.</div></div>

<p>As actually constructed, the wheel casing and bail
in the Sperry compass cannot be placed in the position
shown in <a href="#ip_20">Fig. 20</a>, for the forks at the end of the bail
permit the bail, and therefore the casing, to swing only
through a small angle from the vertical position. It is
clear, however, that if the parts could be moved into the
horizontal position the moment of the force W + <i>w</i>
about the axis H J would be a maximum, just as in this
position the moment of the same force about the axis
E F is a maximum. It is also clear that when the parts
are in the vertical position the force W + <i>w</i> has no turning
moment about either axis. In an intermediate
position (<a href="#ip_21">Fig. 21</a>) the moment of the force W + <i>w</i> about
the axis E F is proportional to <i>a c</i>—that is, to the component
of <i>a b</i> perpendicular to the plane of the casing
or disc—just as it would be if the pin were central or
if the bail formed a rigid part of the casing. The moment
of W + <i>w</i> about the axis H J is likewise proportional
to the component <i>a c</i>. As the value of the component<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
<i>a c</i>, at least for small angles of swing, is proportional
to the angle of swing θ, the net result of making the pin
excentric and introducing a phantom ring is to apply
to the casing when it is deflected (1) the ordinary moment
of the weight W about the axis E F, and (2) an additional
moment about the axis H J. This latter moment is proportional
to the angle of swing θ, and in the position
shown in <a href="#ip_21">Fig. 21</a> tends to turn the casing in the direction
of the arrow R. If the deflection is towards the other
side of the axis E F, the moment applied about H J will
clearly tend to rotate the casing in the opposite direction,
as shown at T. Comparing Figs. <a href="#ip_21">21</a> and <a href="#ip_16">16</a>, it will be seen
that the excentricity of the pin in the Sperry compass
secures exactly the same result as the air blast reaction
produces in the Anschütz compass.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the excentric pin in the Sperry
compass is displaced towards the east when the axle is
resting on the meridian. If it were displaced towards the
west the force applied about the vertical axis would be
reversed in its effect, and would tend to increase the
oscillations of the sensitive element and not to damp
them, as is the intention.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DAMPING SYSTEM OF THE BROWN COMPASS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">In</span> both the Sperry and the early Anschütz compass the
natural oscillation of the sensitive element about the
vertical axis is damped by applying a retarding moment
to the element about this same axis, the strength of the
retarding moment being at all times proportional to the
velocity with which the element is moving in the course
of its vibration. The opposition exercised by the retarding
force is not, however, a direct one. The motion of the
sensitive element arises from the fact that the spinning
wheel, the axle, and the pendulous weight are tilted about
the horizontal axis E F. The retarding force is applied
about the vertical axis, not because that is the axis on
which the sensitive element is oscillating, but because a
force so applied produces a movement about the horizontal
axis tending to wipe out the tilt and so eliminate
the cause of the oscillation.</p>

<div id="ip_22" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 29.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_p060.jpg" width="476" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 22.</span> Gyro-Pendulum with Axle Tilted.</div></div>

<p>An alternative method of damping the oscillation is
possible. The effectiveness of the pendulous weight may
be damped by virtually reducing the weight of the
pendulum bob instead of reducing the tilt at which it is
acting. In <a href="#ip_22">Fig. 22</a> the wheel of a gyro-pendulum system
is shown tilted. The weight S is trying to turn the wheel
on the horizontal axis E F in the direction R, and as a
consequence is causing precession about the vertical axis
H J in the direction T. Instead of attempting to damp
this precession by applying a force about the vertical axis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
so as to reduce the tilt, we might virtually reduce the
weight S by applying an upward force W at the end B of
the axle, or, what is the same thing, a downward force V
at the other end. Such a force, if it were acting alone,
would tend to turn the wheel in the direction opposed to
that of the arrow R, and would consequently cause the
wheel to process on the vertical axis in the direction
opposed to that of the arrow T. Acting in conjunction
with the weight S, the force W would thus damp the
natural motion by endeavouring to produce a counter
precession of the wheel about the vertical axis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
This alternative method of damping the oscillations is
adopted in the Brown gyro-compass. The mechanism of
the Brown method is shown diagrammatically in <a href="#ip_23">Fig. 23</a>.
The wheel, as in the early Anschütz compass, runs in an
enclosing case, and acts as a blower, developing a pressure
of about 3 in. of water. At each side of the casing a bottle
L, M is attached to the housing of the axle. A pipe N
connects the bottoms of the bottles, while a second pipe P
joins their upper ends. At its mid point the pipe P is
interrupted, and a box Q is inserted in the gap. This box,
as shown separately, is open on the underside, and is
provided with a central partition. The air from the
casing is delivered through the hollow trunnion F, and
passes upwards into the box Q from the orifice R.</p>

<p>When the axle is horizontal the air blast entering the
box Q is divided into two equal portions by the central
partition, and exerts an equal pressure inside the bottles.
These two bottles are half-filled with oil, which under the
equal air pressures and the horizontal configuration of the
system lies at an equal level in each bottle, and does not
therefore unbalance the sensitive element on the axis
E F. If, however, the axle tilts the balance is disturbed.
Thus if the end B rises the box tilting with the wheel will
assume some such position relatively to the nipple R—which
is free of the trunnion F—as that shown at T. The
central partition will divide the air jet unequally, and
a greater pressure will therefore be exerted inside the
bottle L than in the bottle M. Thus the oil level in L
falls, while the oil level in M rises. The difference in the
weights of the two bodies of oil acts as a turning moment
tending to rotate the casing about the horizontal axis
E F in the direction U—that is to say, in the direction
opposed to that in which the pendulum weight S is trying
to turn the casing. Since the pendulum weight causes
precession about H J in the direction V, the weight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
unbalanced oil will cause or tend to cause precession about
H J in the reverse direction.</p>

<div id="ip_23" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p062.jpg" width="600" height="330" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 23.</span> Damping System of Brown Compass.</div></div>

<p>Should the end B of the axle fall, the air jet will
exercise excess of pressure in the bottle M, the oil level
will rise in the bottle L, and as a consequence will tend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
to make the system precess about H J in the direction of
the arrow V. Thus in both cases the precession which
would be produced by the unbalanced weight of oil if it
acted alone is in the reverse direction to that produced by
pendulum weight when the axle tilts under the rotation
of the earth.</p>

<p>As the excess of pressure in either bottle varies with
the ratio in which the central partition of the box Q
divides the air blast, and as that ratio varies with the
angle of tilt, it follows that the opposition of the applied
precession increases with the angle of tilt, and therefore
with the rate at which the sensitive element is turning on
H J under the influence of the pendulum weight S. The
system therefore fulfils the requirements of a satisfactory
damping method.</p>

<p>It may be noted that were the air blast and the box
Q suppressed and the pipe P made continuous, a tilt of
the axle would cause oil to flow from one bottle to the
other in the endeavour of the liquid to preserve its surface
horizontal. This flow might be constricted by means of
a valve in the pipe N, and would then serve to damp
the oscillations, for the arrangement would constitute
virtually an oil dashpot. This plan would not prove
satisfactory in practice, because the tilts which are
attained are so small that the amount of oil flowing
between the bottles would be insignificant. Further, the
flow would almost certainly lag behind the movement to
be damped. The application of the air blast to the surface
of the oil greatly increases the rate of flow of the oil and
correctly synchronises it with the tilt. The extent to
which the damping effect is allowed to act on the system
can be regulated by means of a needle valve in one of the
bottles, which valve is made to control the orifice in the
bottom of the bottle through which the pipe N enters.</p>

<p>The damping system adopted in the latest form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Anschütz compass cannot very conveniently be described
at this point. It will be dealt with later on in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">Chapter XVII</a>.
For the present it is sufficient to say that the
system used is in principle very similar to that found
in the Brown compass.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LATITUDE ERROR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Having</span> explained the necessity for damping the horizontal
vibrations of the gyro-compass axle and how the
damping force is generated and applied in the Anschütz,
Sperry, and Brown compasses, we are now in a position
to discuss the various errors to which the gyro-compass is
open and how those errors are in practice eliminated,
reduced, or allowed for.</p>

<p>The first error to which we shall turn our attention
is that known as the latitude error. This error is a direct
consequence of the necessity we are under of damping the
horizontal vibrations of the compass axle.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that in any latitude other than the
equator the compass rests on the north with a slight tilt
up or down of the axle, the tilt increasing progressively
as the poles are approached and being upwards in northern
latitudes and downwards in southern. The tilt acquired
in any latitude is perforce and automatically just sufficient
to precess the axle westwardly or eastwardly at the
rate required at that latitude to keep the axle on the north
once it has found it.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, then, that a compass of the early
Anschütz type is stationed in some degree of northern
latitude. The axle in acquiring the appropriate tilt will
clearly disturb the equilibrium between the two sections
of the air blast. As the axle tilts its north end B upwards
the north section of the air blast will enlarge and the
southern diminish in area. Thus the tilting of the axle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
brings into play an air blast reaction which is applied as a
moment tending to turn the sensitive element about the
vertical axis H J in such a way as to make the north end
move eastwardly. The actual movement produced will,
in accordance with the fundamental rule, be a precession
of the axle about the horizontal axis, the end B going
down. Thus the tilt upwards of the axle required for the
correct working of the compass is opposed. It is not
allowed to acquire the full value which it should have,
but instead stops at the point at which a balance is struck
between the upward moving tendency of the axle resulting
from the earth’s rotation and the downward moving
tendency caused by the uneven air blast reaction. The
westerly precession of the axle about the vertical axis is
now that arising from the reduced angle of tilt, and is
less than the rate required to keep the end B pointing
to the north. The resulting deviation is known as the
latitude error. Its magnitude depends upon the latitude
and upon such factors as the speed of the wheel, its
efficiency as a blower and other items incidental to the
particular design of the compass.</p>

<p>In the Sperry compass the latitude error arises from an
exactly similar cause. Thus the tilt of the axle is transmitted
through the excentric pin to the casing as a
moment about the vertical axis H J, tending to make the
north end of the axle move over to the east, and therefore
causing the axle to precess vertically downwards
until the position of balance is reached.</p>

<p>In the Brown compass, on the other hand, it is claimed
that there is no latitude error. Thus when in northern
latitudes the north end of the axle tilts upwards under its
unsatisfied desire to set itself parallel with the earth’s
polar axis, the air blast is divided unequally between the
two partitions of the box. Excess pressure is exerted
inside the damping bottle attached to the northern face
of the wheel casing, and as a result an excess of oil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
accumulates in the damping bottle on the south side. The
weight of the excess oil applies a turning moment to the
spinning wheel about the horizontal axis, and tends to
lift the north end of the axle upwards in opposition to the
pendulum weight, which tends to turn it downwards
about the same axis. Thus in this compass the natural
tilt of the axle is not interfered with by the action of the
damping arrangement, for that action is applied about
the horizontal axis E F, and not, as in the Anschütz and
Sperry compasses, about the vertical axis H J. The
damping action in the Brown compass is virtually equivalent
to a subtraction from the weight of the pendulum
bob, and is not applied, as in the other compasses, to the
reduction of the tilt of the axle. It tends, therefore, to
reduce the natural rate of westerly precession required at
the given latitude to keep the axle on the north. Actually,
however, the tilt acquired by the axle will take cognisance
of the reduction in the weight of the bob caused by
the weight of the excess oil. The north end of the axle
will rise until the effective moment of the bob—that is,
the moment due to its own actual weight less the moment
due to the excess oil in the southern damping bottle—is
such as will automatically generate the required rate of
westerly precession for the given latitude.</p>

<p>In the Anschütz and Sperry compasses the latitude
error can be allowed for by shifting the position of the
lubber line relatively to the ship’s longitudinal centre line
in accordance with calculated tables of the error. The
exact value of the error depends upon the design of the
compass, but in both types it increases with the latitude.
Analysis shows that—at least in the early Anschütz
compass—the latitude error may be neglected if the
change of latitude is less than 10 deg. In the Sperry
compass, as we shall see presently, the movement of the
lubber line to correct the latitude error is effected by a
very pretty piece of mechanism, which also can control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the position of the lubber line to allow for a second error
to which the compass is open, to wit, the so-called “north
steaming error.”</p>

<p>In some respects as an alternative to moving the lubber
line, the latitude error may be completely eliminated for
a particular latitude—the latitude of most frequent use
would naturally be chosen—by attaching a small weight
to the north side of the wheel casing. In the early
Anschütz compass such a weight was provided as indicated
at T in <a href="#ip_16">Fig. 16</a>. This weight and its position were so
chosen that at 50 deg. north of the equator its moment
about the horizontal axis E F, when the axle of the
compass was horizontal, was just sufficient to supply to
the wheel the amount of westerly precession required to
keep the axle pointing to the north. The axle being
horizontal in that latitude, the air blast was equally
divided by the pendulum shutter, and as a result the rate
of westerly precession produced by the weight T was not
affected by the existence of the damping system. At
other latitudes, of course, the latitude error arose, and at
the equator—where ordinarily there should be no latitude
error—and south of the equator, the error became worse
than it would have been without the addition of the
weight, unless the weight and its position were adjusted.
With the compass corrected for 50 deg. N. latitude the
error had the following values:</p>

In the Sperry compass no attempt is made to eliminate
the latitude error at any particular latitude, the correction
applied to the lubber line being solely relied upon to
allow for it. In this compass, therefore, the latitude error
is zero at the equator. At 50 deg. north or south it
amounts to 2 deg., easterly and westerly respectively.
A feature found in this type of gyro-compass of a connected
nature calls, however, for mention at this point.
This feature consists of mounting the pivots M N
(<a href="#ip_19">Fig. 19</a>), on which the bail swings, within excentric
housings and graduating the edge of the housings with a
scale of latitudes. In this way the pivots can be displaced
to one side or the other of the vertical plane containing
the axis H J by an amount proportional to the latitude.
When the spinning wheel is at rest, this displacement
makes the angle between the axle of the wheel and the
plumb line through the centre of gravity of the bail a
little less or a little more than a right angle, and in
northern latitudes makes the north end of the axle dip
below the horizontal and in southern latitudes rise above
it. The scale is so graduated that the dip of the axle or
its rise when the wheel is not running is just equal to the
natural rise or dip which the axle would acquire at any
given latitude with the wheel running and with the bail
pivots in the mean position. As a result, when the
compass is in service and the bail pivots are adjusted for
the latitude of the station, the natural rise or dip of the
axle leaves the axle horizontal, but deflects the bail weight
from the vertical by the amount required to generate the
correct degree of easterly or westerly precession.</p>

<p>Thus in the Sperry compass the axle, if the latitude bail
correction is applied, is at all latitudes horizontal when
resting on the north. Several advantages are thus
secured, the chief being that the effect of any change in
the speed of the spinning wheel or of a complete failure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
the electric supply driving the wheel is greatly reduced or
spread over a longer interval. Were the axle as well as
the bail allowed to acquire the rise or dip proper to the
latitude, the axle during a change of speed of the wheel
would tend to deviate and develop an error which might
prove misleading. If, however, the axle is not allowed to
acquire the rise or dip appropriate to the latitude, the
error introduced by a change in the speed of the wheel
takes longer to manifest itself, and is reduced in magnitude.
As it is difficult to guarantee that the voltage of
the current supplied to the compass will not vary, this
feature of the Sperry compass is undoubtedly of practical
advantage.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE NORTH STEAMING ERROR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> source of error which we have just discussed affects
the gyro-compass whether it is on land or on a ship. We
have now to discuss certain errors which are only met
with when the compass is mounted on board a moving
ship.</p>

<p>The first of these errors to which we will refer is sometimes
called the “north steaming error,” although it is
equally associated with a due south course. Imagine the
vessel on which the gyro-compass is fitted to be sailing
due east along the equator. If its speed is, say, 20 knots
it would, if it could, circumnavigate the globe in 45 days.
Its velocity round the earth’s axis apart from the rotation
of the earth is thus 0.000015 revolution per minute. As
the speed of the earth on its polar axis is 0.0007 revolution
per minute, the actual rate at which the gyro-axle is being
carried round in space is 0.000715 revolution per minute.
If the vessel is sailing due west its speed opposes that of
the earth, so that the actual rate at which the gyro-axle is
being carried round in space is 0.000685 revolution per
minute. As compared with the same gyro-compass on
land, the only effect of the ship’s speed on these courses is
in the one case to increase the magnitude of the directive
force and in the other case to reduce it, the increase and
reduction both being quite small—about 2 per cent.
actually. Sailing due east or west in latitude 60 deg.
north or south, its speed would cause the vessel to circumnavigate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
the globe in 22½ days. On these courses in
either of these latitudes, therefore, the directive force
would be increased or diminished respectively by about
4 per cent.</p>

<div id="ip_24" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 24.</span> The North Steaming Error at 0 Deg. and 60 Deg. N.</div></div>

<p>If, now, the vessel starts at the equator and sails due
north, its speed is at right angles to the speed with which
the rotation of the earth is carrying the gyro-compass
round in space. The speed of the ship—2026 ft. per
minute—may be represented by A B (<a href="#ip_24">Fig. 24</a>) and the
speed of rotation of the earth—92,400 ft. per minute—by
A C. The actual speed and direction in which the gyro-compass
is being carried round in space is A D, and the
actual axis about which it is being carried round is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the earth’s polar axis N S, but an axis N´ S´ at right
angles to A D. The gyro-axle will settle, therefore, on the
line N´ S´, and not on the true north and south meridian.
The true north will be to the east of the indicated north
by the angle N´ A N, which for the ship speed in question—20
knots—will be 1.25 deg. If the ship starting from
the equator sails due south, the deviation will be towards
the opposite side, the true north lying 1.25 deg. to the
west of that indicated by the compass. If the course is
neither due north or south nor due east or west, the
deviation will have some intermediate value between zero
and 1.25 deg., the true north lying to the east of the
indicated on all courses with a northern component and
to the west on all courses with a southern component.</p>

<p>If the ship is in latitude 60 deg. north, and is steaming
north, its speed will carry it, as before, 2026 ft. northward
per minute, as at E F, but, as its distance from the earth’s
polar axis is now only half what it was at the equator, the
earth’s rotation is carrying it round at only half the
equatorial speed, namely, with a velocity E G of 46,200 ft.
per minute. The compass is therefore being carried round
in space with a velocity represented in magnitude and
direction by E H—that is to say, it is being rotated not
actually about the earth’s polar axis N S, but about an
axis N´´ S´´ at right angles to the resultant velocity E H.
The axle will therefore align itself parallel with N´´ S´´,
and not with N´ S´. Thus in that latitude at the given
speed the true north will lie 2.5 deg. eastward of that
indicated by the compass. On north-easterly or north-westerly
courses at 60 deg. north latitude the deviation
will lie between zero and 2.5 deg., while on all courses
with a southerly component the true north will be to the
west of the indicated north by some amount between the
same two limits. Our demonstration is not strictly
accurate, for, arising from the rotundity of the earth, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
speed E F of the ship is not really in the plane of the
paper, but should be drawn inclined with the end F below
the level of E. Accurate analysis, however, shows that
the deviation arrived at by neglecting this fact is substantially
correct. In the tables issued in connection
with the early Anschütz compass the deviation at 20 knots
due north or south in latitude 60 deg. N. is given as
2.5 deg., while those issued by the Sperry Company give
it, by interpolation, as 2.41 deg.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this error is a natural one—that
is to say, it is not caused by any peculiarity in the design
of the compass in use. The table of deviations on various
courses, at various speeds, in various latitudes, compiled
for one type of compass would be equally applicable to
any other design. In the case of the early type of Anschütz
compass the “north steaming error” was corrected
solely by means of such tables—that is to say, to find the
exact bearing on which the ship was sailing the compass
was read, and from its reading there was subtracted,
or to it there was added, arithmetically, the appropriate
figure taken from the tables, the uncorrected reading being
a sufficiently accurate indication of the true course to
permit it to be assumed as the true course for the purpose
of extracting the correction from the tables.</p>

<p>In the Sperry design the use of similar tables in a
similar way is permissible and is provided for. In
addition, however, provision is made whereby the tables
may be entirely dispensed with and the correction applied
by moving the lubber line relatively to the ship’s fore
and aft direction. In the case of the early Anschütz
compass the lubber line could be moved through 4 deg.
on each side of the position in which it was parallel with
the ship’s fore and aft centre line. This movement was,
however, for the purpose of correcting the latitude error,
and not the north steaming error. In the Sperry compass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
provision is made for moving the lubber line so as to
correct for both errors. The latitude error depends upon
the design of the compass and the latitude. The north
steaming error is independent of the design of the compass,
and is determined by the speed of the ship, the
latitude in which it is sailing, and the course which it is
following. Latitude thus comes into both errors, being
the sole variable causing one, and one of the three variables
causing the other. It is eliminated simultaneously
for both errors, by operating one dial. A second dial is
set to suit the speed of the ship, while the third factor in
the north steaming error, the bearing of the ship’s course,
is automatically brought into the movement of the
lubber line by means of an inclined ring carried round
with the compass card.</p>

<p>A diagram of the Sperry correction mechanism is
given in <a href="#ip_25">Fig. 25</a>. The lubber ring on which the lubber
line is engraved is shown at A. The latitude corrector
dial B is mounted to rotate about its centre and to read
against a fixed scale. It is slotted radially to engage a
pin C on a rod D E, one end of which can slide in a fixed
guide F, while the other is pivoted to a link E G pinned
at H to the lubber ring. If the end G of this link be
imagined pivoted to some fixed point it is clear that
rotation of the dial B will communicate a corresponding
rotation to the lubber ring. The proportions of the parts
and the positions of the pivots and pins are such that by
setting the dial to the latitude in which the vessel is sailing
the lubber ring is rotated through the angle by which the
local latitude error causes the gyro-axle to deviate in its
resting position from the true north and south direction.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<div id="ip_25" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p076.jpg" width="600" height="409" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 25.</span> Sperry Correction Mechanism for Latitude and North Steaming Errors.</div></div>

<p>If the end G of the link E G were pivoted, as we have
supposed it to be, to some fixed point, then the latitude
Error could be applied by itself to the lubber ring. It is
not, however, so fixed, but is pivoted to a link, the end J
of which carries a pin working in a curved slot extending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
from the centre of the speed corrector dial K to its edge.
The radius of this curved slot is struck from the point G
as centre. It follows, therefore, that with the speed
corrector dial in the position shown the end J of the link
G J may be fixed at any point in the curved slot without
affecting the position of the point G. If, however, the
speed corrector dial be rotated about its centre, the movement
of the point G will vary in magnitude with the
position at which the pin J is fixed in the curved slot.
This position is set against the scale of speed in knots
on the edge of the slot, but the setting is without effect
until the speed corrector dial is rotated from the position
shown in the diagram. When it is so rotated a corresponding
movement is communicated to the lubber ring
through the link G E, the end E of which is now to be
regarded as the fixed fulcrum.</p>

<p>The two dials B K are connected by means of a link
L M of length equal to the distance between the dial
centres. The end L of this link is pivoted to a fixed point
on the dial B, but the end M is provided with a pin which
works within a slot in the dial K. Thus the setting of
the dial B to any latitude will not produce rotation of
the dial K, but will merely cause the pin M to slide in its
slot. If, however, the link M N is moved upwards, the
angle through which such movement will rotate the dial
K will depend upon the exact position of the pin M in its
slot—that is to say, upon the setting of the latitude dial.
Thus a movement of the link M N will rotate the lubber
ring by an amount proportional to the movement of
M N, to the setting of the pin J in the curved slot of the
speed dial, and to the setting of the latitude dial.</p>

<p>The link M N is pinned to a lever P Q, the end P of
which is pivoted to a fixed point. The end Q carries
a roller, which engages within the flanges of a ring R
permanently fixed in an inclined position on the phantom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
ring of the compass. The higher end of this ring is situated
directly above the north-seeking end of the gyro-axle,
and the lower end directly above the south-seeking end,
its east and west diameter being aligned horizontally.</p>

<p>In the position shown in the diagram the ship is
supposed to be sailing due west. Under this condition,
as we know, no north steaming error is involved, the
latitude error only applying. The dial B can therefore
be set to the latitude in which the vessel is sailing so as
to apply the latitude correction by itself to the lubber
ring. At the same time the pin J can be set to read the
ship’s speed—17 knots in the case shown. The movement
of the link J G involved in this setting will, as we
have seen, not alter the setting of the lubber ring, nor
will the setting of the dial B rotate the dial K from the
position shown. The two settings are, however, ready
to modify the adjustment of the lubber ring as soon as
any movement of the link M N occurs. Such a movement
arises if the vessel alters course towards the north or
south or intermediately, for when the course is altered
the links, dials, and lubber ring move with the ship,
while the compass card and the course corrector ring R
remain stationary. The roller at Q therefore rises or falls
towards the north or south end of the ring, and produces
a rotation of the dial K. The amount of the modification
thus produced in the setting of the lubber ring relatively
to the ship’s centre line will depend upon (1) the setting
of the pin M—that is to say, the setting of the latitude dial;
(2) the setting of the pin J on the speed dial; and (3)
the extent of the turn towards the north or south. In
this way the correction for the north steaming error is
automatically added to or subtracted from the correction
for the latitude error to the correct amount on all occasions
when the ship’s course is altered so as to have a northerly
or southerly component, the adjustment for the error<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
being automatically wiped out in all latitudes when
the ship’s course is again brought east and west. The
mechanism, it will be seen, merely by the setting of two
dials, takes cognisance of three independent variables,
of which one enters into the required adjustment in a
twofold way.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The total correction is indicated on the
corrector scale S attached to the binnacle independently
of the lubber ring.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that neither the latitude error
nor the north steaming error is in the strict sense of the
word eliminated, but is only allowed for, automatically
or arithmetically, when the compass is read—that is to
say, no attempt is made to force the gyro-axle to rest in
the true north and south position in all latitudes at all
speeds on all courses. The crucial angle by which the
ship is navigated is the angle between its longitudinal
centre line and the true meridian. A constant straight
course will be held if this angle is maintained constant.
If the indicated meridian on the compass is open to error,
the constancy of the navigating angle may be preserved
by introducing a similar error into the degree of coincidence
between the lubber line and the longitudinal
centre line of the ship. The readings of the master compass
may therefore be used for the purpose of maintaining
the ship on a given course or for setting it on a new
one. But for taking the bearing of some passing object,
the fact that it may not be indicating true north may
render the observation somewhat more troublesome
than it need be. To overcome the difficulty here involved
the repeaters served by the master compass are arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
to indicate true north under all conditions, provided the
latitude and speed dials on the master compass are correctly
set. The repeaters are operated electrically, the
first element in the transmission system between them and
the master compass being a pinion meshing with the gear
wheel attached to the phantom ring beneath the master
compass card. This pinion is mounted on the lubber
ring, and therefore rotates with the ship round the card
when the course is altered. But, as it is mounted on the
lubber ring, it also partakes of the movement of this ring
relatively to the ship produced by the correction mechanism.
Thus the net indication transmitted to the repeaters
when the ship changes course or latitude or speed is
compounded of the relative motion of the master compass
card and of the lubber ring. The reading of the
repeaters thus shows the true north. A pelorus or
dummy compass may be combined with the repeaters
to facilitate the taking of bearings. In war vessels the
actual navigation of the ship is preferably conducted
from a repeater, the master compass for safety in action
being disposed below the armoured deck.</p>

<p>The Sperry compass is peculiarly complete in the provision
made for taking account of the latitude and north
steaming errors. The Brown compass, as we have seen,
is free from latitude error, so that the north steaming
error alone has to be dealt with. This error may be
allowed for arithmetically in the usual way by means
of tables of corrections to be applied to the readings of
the master compass. As regards the repeaters, the error
is eliminated by a method involving the mounting of the
repeater cards excentrically, the excentricity being varied
to suit the latitude, speed, and course.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BALLISTIC DEFLECTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Having</span> considered the effect of the ship’s speed upon
the readings of the gyro-compass, we have next to discuss
the effect of the conditions which arise when the speed
is changed. It is clear, of course, that if the ship’s speed
is changed, say from 20 to 10 knots, the north steaming
error appropriate to the course and latitude will fall to
half its value when the new speed has been attained.
Two questions, however, may be asked. What happens
in the period during which the speed is changing, and what
time elapses between the attainment of the new speed and
the attainment by the compass of the new north steaming
error proper to the new speed?</p>

<p>If an ordinary simple pendulum were hung from the
roof of a railway carriage it would be found that so long
as the train was travelling smoothly at <em>uniform</em> speed
the pendulum would hang vertically without oscillating
just as it would do if the train were at rest. If the train
increased its speed the inertia of the pendulum—that is
to say, its tendency to go on moving with the old velocity—would
cause the pendulum to assume an inclined
position <em>behind</em> the vertical, the deflection being proportional
to the rate at which the train was gathering
speed. At the instant at which the train ceased to gather
speed, and again assumed a uniform velocity, the tendency
for the pendulum to remain inclined to the vertical
would vanish, but the deflection it possessed at that instant
would result in its acquiring an oscillation which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
would persist until friction, etc., damped it out. If when
the pendulum were again steady and hanging vertically,
the train began to slow down, a similar series of events
would occur, only on that occasion the inertia of the bob
would cause the pendulum while the train was losing
speed to assume a <em>forwardly</em> inclined position, the angle
of which would be a measure of the rate at which the speed
was being reduced. On the attainment of the new uniform
speed the pendulum would oscillate for a time, as
before.</p>

<p>The gyro-compass is in part a pendulous body, and on
a ship changing speed or acquiring speed from rest or
coming to a stop it is open to the action of inertia forces
just as is our railway carriage pendulum. As a result
the compass during the change of speed may exhibit an
error—the ballistic error, as it is called—on top of the
existing north steaming error. Since the speed of a ship,
at least of a merchant ship, cannot be changed very
quickly, and since, further, the speed of a ship, at least
on long voyages, is not liable to be changed very often,
it might be thought that this transient ballistic error
could be neglected. It probably could be safely neglected
if its effect were strictly confined to the actual period of
the change in the speed, but it is not so confined. We
have to bear in mind the subsequent vibration of the
railway carriage pendulum. A similar oscillation is set up
in the gyro-compass after the new speed is attained.
Since the period of oscillation of the compass is about
85 minutes, and as two or three complete swings have
to be made before the damping arrangements can suppress
the vibration, it follows that the compass will not
settle in its resting position again until two or three hours
after the new speed has been attained, although the
actual change of speed may have been effected inside
five minutes or less.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 26.</span> Ballistic Force on Compass when Ship’s Speed Changes.</div></div>

<p>If the ship is sailing on an east-west course, as represented
in <a href="#ip_26">Fig. 26</a>, any change of speed will tend to cause
the pendulum weight S to move in the direction R or T,
according as the change of speed is a decrease or an
increase. Such a tendency will merely throw stresses on
to the journals at E F and H J, or, if the equivalent of the
square outer frame is carried on gimbals, as it actually
is in practice, then the tendency to rotate will be translated
into an actual movement of the sensitive element
on the axis of the outer mounting coincident or parallel
with the axle B C of the wheel. Such a movement will
have no gyroscopic effect on the compass, for the axle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
is not subjected by it to any non-parallel displacement.
No ballistic deflection will therefore occur on that
course.</p>

<div id="ip_27" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p084.jpg" width="440" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 27.</span> Ballistic Force on Compass when Ship’s Speed Changes.</div></div>

<p>If the ship changes speed while on a west to east course,
the change is similarly without effect on the compass.
Strictly speaking, we ought to say that the change of
speed will have no effect on the compass if the ship’s
course is at right angles to the direction in which the axle
of the wheel is pointing. Only at the equator would this
course be due east or west. In other latitudes the latitude
error has to be reckoned with, so that the particular
course on which changes of speed are without effect on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
the compass must be slightly south or north of due east
or west.</p>

<p>If, now, the ship is steaming due north, as indicated
in <a href="#ip_27">Fig. 27</a>, a reduction of its speed will tend to make the
pendulum weight swing forward about the east and west
axis E F in the direction P. This tendency is clearly
equivalent to the application of an upward force to the
end B of the axle, and hence, as we know, will cause the
wheel to precess, the end B of the axle going eastwards.
As this precession continues it is opposed by the ever-increasing
restoring moment of the directive force, so
that in the end the axle assumes a position in which the
directive force just balances the ballistic deflective
force. This ballistic deflection remains constant all the
time the ship’s speed is falling. When the speed reaches
the new steady value the axle slowly oscillates back to the
true resting position.</p>

<p>It is clear that a reduction of speed on a northerly
course and an increase of speed on a southerly produce
ballistic deflections in a like direction, the north end of
the axle moving towards the east. An increase of speed
on a northerly course or a decrease of speed on a southerly
produces a westerly ballistic deflection. On intermediate
courses deflections of a like kind, but of intermediate
value, are caused, for the north and south <em>component</em>
of the change of speed is alone effective in tilting the
wheel about the east and west axis E F.</p>

<p>Imagine a ship steaming due north at 20 knots and
changing its speed to 10 knots during a period of five
minutes. As it is steaming north there will be a north
steaming error, the axle pointing westwards of true north
by an amount dependent upon the speed of the ship and
the latitude in which it is sailing. Let O N (<a href="#ip_28">Fig. 28</a>) be
the direction of true north, and let O A be the direction
in which the axle of the gyro-compass aligns itself when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
speed is 20 knots, the angle N O A being the combined
latitude and north steaming errors. Let O B be the
resting position for the axle when the ship’s speed is 10
knots, the angle N O B being the latitude error—which
has not altered—plus the north steaming error—which is
now less because of the reduced speed. As the speed
is being reduced, the ballistic action of the pendulum
weight causes the axle temporarily to turn eastwards
from the true resting position and to align itself in some
direction O C. When the ship has settled down to 10
knots, the axle leaving the position O C vibrates about
O B with amplitudes which are being continually reduced
by the action of the damping system.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 28.</span> Ballistic Deflection.</div></div>

<p>The point of importance to notice is that the temporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
ballistic deflection O C is eastward of O A, just as is O B
the new resting position for the axle. This result is a
general one. Had the speed been increased instead of
decreased, the ballistic deflection would have been westward
of O A, just as would be the new resting position
for the axle at the increased speed. Similarly, on due
southerly courses or on quadrantal courses the ballistic
deflection produced by any change of speed is always
in the same direction as that in which the axle moves
in passing from the old to the new north steaming error.
This being so, it is conceivable that at least, under certain
conditions, the ballistic deflection position O C may
coincide with the new position O B for the axle under the
new north steaming error. Should such a result be
obtained, the ballistic action will, on a change of speed
occurring, swing the axle straight away into the new
resting position. Thus O C and O B being coincident,
there will be no tendency for the axle to oscillate about
O B when the speed assumes the new steady value, so
that the axle will swing into the new resting position in a
“dead-beat” manner. The effect of the ballistic action
will thus be confined to the period during which the speed
is being changed—five minutes in our example—and will
not influence the readings of the compass for a period
of anything up to two or three hours after the new speed
is reached.</p>

<p>The ballistic deflection of a pendulum hung from the
roof of a railway carriage is dependent upon the length
of the pendulum, and therefore upon its period of natural
vibration. So, too, the ballistic deflection of the gyro-compass
is dependent upon the period of its vibration
about the north and south direction. Once the characteristics
of the compass are determined, therefore, the angle
A O C (<a href="#ip_28">Fig. 28</a>) of the ballistic deflection is settled by
(1) the direction of the ship’s course, and (2) by the rate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
at which the ship’s speed towards the north or south is
being changed. It is not affected by the latitude in which
the ship is sailing, the deflection produced by a change of
10 knots in five minutes being the same at the equator as
in 60 deg. or any other latitude.</p>

<p>Coming to the difference between the old and the new
north steaming errors, it will be seen from our previous
explanation of the errors themselves that the magnitude
of the angle A O B is independent of the design of the
compass in use. It will vary with (1) the direction of the
ship’s course, and (2) the extent by which the ship’s
speed is changed. In addition, it will also vary with (3)
the latitude in which the ship is sailing.</p>

<p>From these considerations it is argued that by suitably
selecting the period of vibration the ballistic deflection
can be made <em>for one particular latitude</em> just equal to the
difference between the north steaming errors for any
initial and any new speed on any course. In practice
the latitude selected is 40 deg. north or south. It is found
by calculation that the period of vibration which must
be given to the compass to secure this dead-beat ballistic
deflection is such that in this latitude the compass
should oscillate in the same period as would a simple
pendulum, the length of which was equal to the radius
of the earth. It is for this reason that all modern gyro-compasses
have a period of vibration of approximately
85 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
In latitudes other than 40 deg. north or south the ballistic
deflection will not be dead-beat, but by taking this
latitude as the mean the subsequent oscillation after a
change of speed is—in mercantile vessels at least—sufficiently
small to introduce no error of great importance,
except for purposes of very accurate observation, in which
case the observation, if possible, would not be made
until the vessel had been running for two or three hours
after the last considerable change of speed.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that the ballistic error may arise
when the ship is altering course without altering its speed.
Thus, if it is sailing north and makes a sharp turn eastwards
or westwards, the speed northwards during the
turn falls progressively from a maximum at the beginning
to zero at the end of the turn, even although the actual
linear speed of the ship remains constant throughout.
Turning in either direction is thus equivalent to a deceleration
of the ship’s northerly speed, so that an easterly
ballistic deflection may be expected in both cases. On
the other hand, a turn towards the north from a due
east or west course is equivalent to an acceleration of
the ship’s northerly speed, and, as a result, a westerly
ballistic deflection is produced. In latitude 40 deg.
north or south both these ballistic deflections would be
dead-beat in a modern gyro-compass, being just sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
in the one case to eliminate and in the other to apply the
appropriate north steaming error.</p>

<p>In a very recent improvement, it is understood, it has
been found possible to provide means whereby the ballistic
deflection is made dead-beat in <em>all</em> latitudes.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE QUADRANTAL ERROR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Let</span> a stone be tied to the end of a string and be flung
forward while the free end of the string is held in the
hand. Let the hand holding the free end be moved
forward at first with the same speed as the stone in its
flight, and then let the hand be drawn back. We know
that as soon as the string becomes taut—if it were not
already fully extended—the hand would feel a pull
exerted on it in the direction in which the stone was
initially projected. This pull arises from the fact that the
stone has been given momentum in the direction of its
flight, and while this momentum is being taken out of it
by the backward pull of the hand and new momentum in
the backward direction is being communicated to it the
stone reacts forcibly on the string and therefore on the
hand.</p>

<p>In the gyro-compass the pendulum weight may be
likened to the stone, the stirrup carrying the weight to
the string, and the spinning wheel to the hand. While the
ship is steaming at a uniform speed, the system is in the
condition existing just after the stone has been projected
from the hand, and while the hand is following it
with equal speed. A change in the ship’s speed—a
reduction of its speed to be quite correct in our analogy—is
comparable with the drawing back of the hand. The
pull of the stone exerted on the hand at this instant is
represented by the tendency of the weight to continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
moving at the former speed, and the resultant “kick”
which by its attempt to do so it applies to the spinning
wheel. This kick is communicated to the spinning wheel
through stiff members and rigid connections, and not
through a flexible string. It really acts at the centre of
gravity of the pendulum weight, and is therefore felt by
the spinning wheel, not as a straight pull, but as a force
tending to turn the wheel about the horizontal axis E F.</p>

<p>The kick of the weight when the ship changes speed on
any course having a north or south component produces,
as we have seen, a transient ballistic error which may
influence the correctness of the compass readings for some
hours after the change of speed has been completed. We
have now to show that similar kicks occur under other
conditions, and may similarly affect the accuracy of the
readings.</p>

<p>The subject which we are about to discuss is the
so-called quadrantal error which, unless steps are taken
to eliminate it, appears in the compass readings when the
ship is sailing in a rough sea on any course other than due
north, south, east, or west. It is caused by the rolling
and pitching of the ship. The efforts made to eliminate it
have influenced the evolution of the gyro-compass to a
greater extent than probably those directed towards overcoming
or allowing for all the other errors combined to
which the device is open.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 29.</span> Effect of Rolling on due North Course.</div></div>

<p>The gyro-compass on board ship is usually, although
in no way necessarily, mounted above the vessel’s metacentres—transverse
and longitudinal—about which
rolling and pitching take place. In <a href="#ip_29">Fig. 29</a> we show a
section, looking aft, of a vessel steaming due north with
a gyro-compass mounted on its deck. It is clear that, so
far as the weight S is concerned, it may be regarded when
the ship rolls as the bob of an inverted pendulum vibrating
in an east and west plane, through an angle equal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the angle of the ship’s roll. From what we have already
said, it will be seen that at the end of a roll to port the
hand holding the string attached to the flying stone,
hitherto following it, begins its withdrawal to the east.
The weight checked in its movement to the west communicates
a kick to the sensitive element. This kick, a
westward force, is applied at the centre of gravity of the
weight, and clearly does nothing more than throw a stress
on to the journals at E F and H J, and through the square
frame on to the deck. It does not therefore affect the
direction in which the gyro-axle is pointing. If, as is
actually the case in practice, the equivalent of the square
frame is not fixed directly to the deck, but is mounted
inside the binnacle on athwartship and longitudinal
gimbals, the square frame will swing on the longitudinal
gimbal axis. The weight S will, however, still act during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
the ship’s roll as an inverted pendulum, as at Z Z, in
which the bob remains more or less parallel with its
original direction. Under these conditions the kick of the
weight at the end of a roll to port will rotate the frame in
the direction of the curved arrow about the longitudinal
gimbal axis. As this axis is coincident or parallel with the
gyro-axle, the gyro-axle is not moved otherwise than
parallel with itself either by the actual roll of the ship or
by the kick of the weight at either out position. Thus
a ship steaming north may roll with impunity without
affecting the accuracy of the direction in which the gyro-axle
is pointing.</p>

<div id="ip_30" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p094.jpg" width="600" height="573" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 30.</span> Effect of Rolling on due West Course.</div></div>

<p>It is clear that rolling on a due south course or <em>pitching</em>
on a due east or west course is similarly without effect on
the gyro-compass.</p>

<p>Now consider the case of the ship <em>rolling</em> when on a due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
west course (<a href="#ip_30">Fig. 30</a>). It is clear that here again the
weight S may by itself be considered as the bob of an
inverted pendulum vibrating through the angle of the
ship’s roll, this time in a north and south plane. The
weight S has, in addition, its own pendulum action on the
horizontal axis E F, and tends to keep the gyro-axle
horizontal throughout the roll.</p>

<p>At the end of a roll to port the kick of the weight S,
a southerly force acting at the centre of gravity of the
weight, tends to turn the spinning wheel in the direction
R about the horizontal east and west axis E F. This kick
is clearly equivalent to the application of an upward force
at the end C of the axle or a <em>downward</em> force at the end B,
and therefore, as we know, will cause the axle not to turn
about E F, but to precess the north end B towards the
<em>west</em> about the axis H J.</p>

<p>The roll to starboard now takes place, and at its end
the kick of the weight occurs in the northerly direction.
This kick will tend to turn the spinning wheel about the
east and west axis E F in the direction T, and is clearly
equivalent to the application of an <em>upward</em> force at the
end B of the axle. Such a force, as we know, will cause
the end B of the axle to precess towards the <em>east</em>.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the western deflection of the
axle produced by the precession which occurs at the end
of the roll to port is counterbalanced and automatically
eliminated by the eastern deflection produced by the
precession occurring at the end of the roll to starboard.
The only effect on the compass caused by the rolling of
the ship is therefore a vibration of the axle about the
north and south direction. We should really say that the
only effect is the application to the sensitive element of a
vibratory influence in tune with the rolling of the ship.
As the ship’s period is very small compared with that of
the compass about the axis H J—about 5 to 12 seconds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
as compared with about 85 minutes—this vibratory
influence practically fails to disturb the steadiness with
which the axle points to the north.</p>

<p>It is clear that pitching of the ship when on a due west
course has the same effect—or lack of effect—on the
compass as rolling on a due north course, and that pitching
on a due north course has the same effect as rolling on
a due west course. It is further clear that due south and
due east courses are similar in this respect to due north
and due west courses. Thus when the ship is on a cardinal
course neither pitching nor rolling disturbs the axle of the
spinning wheel from its north resting position.</p>

<p>Matters are quite otherwise, however, when the course
is an inter-cardinal, or quadrantal, one. The discovery
of this unlikely fact was in large part due to the investigations
of the Compass Department of the British
Admiralty. It does not appear to have been known, or at
least its full significance does not seem to have been
appreciated, in the earlier days of gyro-compass construction.
At least one early design of compass—the
Anschütz of 1910—did not include means of eliminating
or allowing for the “quadrantal error,” and soon became
obsolete as a result primarily of the omission. That the
later design of Anschütz compass successfully overcomes
the difficulties introduced by this error is shown by the
admitted excellence of the navigation of the German
submarines, which vessels were universally fitted with
compasses of this design, and which, like all their class,
suffer much from rolling and pitching.</p>

<p>So far we have been able to use a very simple model to
demonstrate the properties and errors of the gyro-compass.
We have now reached a subject which, if
it is to be explained correctly, requires us to adopt a
model of a more elaborate nature, one in which the outer
square frame of our simple model is itself mounted on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
pair of gimbal axes. We have already referred to this
type of mounting in our second chapter and above in connection
with <a href="#ip_29">Fig. 29</a>. In <a href="#ip_31">Fig. 31</a> we show it with the
pendulous weight added to the sensitive element. We
may take it that the axis T U, about which the entire
compass system may swing, is parallel with the longitudinal
centre line of the ship, and that the frame Y is
fixed to the deck.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 33.</span> Effect of Rolling on a Due North Course (External Gimbal Mounting).</div></div>

<p>In order to make quite clear the difference between
the two forms of mounting, we give in Figs. <a href="#ip_32">32</a> and <a href="#ip_33">33</a>
two corresponding sets of views showing the compass
system on a ship while steaming due north and rolling.
With the simple mounting (<a href="#ip_32">Fig. 32</a>) the weight S constantly
remains radially below the centre of the spinning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
wheel, and the kicks which it applies at the out port and
out starboard positions merely stress the compass
mountings. With the more elaborate mounting (<a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>)
the weight tends to remain constantly in the vertical
below the centre of the spinning wheel, but the kicks
occurring at the out positions, if the rolling is continued
for any length of time, cause it to swing beyond the
vertical, so that as the ship rolls the whole compass
system acquires an oscillation on the axis T U (<a href="#ip_31">Fig. 31</a>)
in tune with the rolls. It is to be noted that the period of
vibration of the compass system about the axis T U is
very much less than that of the sensitive element about
the axis H J. The latter, as we have seen, is about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
85 minutes, and is determined, in part at least, by the
high speed of the spinning wheel. About T U the vibration,
however, does not call any gyroscopic force into play,
for it takes place without causing the axle of the spinning
wheel to alter its direction. The period of this vibration
is therefore not affected by the speed of the spinning
wheel. It may be quite small—from one to two seconds—and
therefore comparable with the ship’s rolling period.
If, then, no steps are taken to prevent it, the compass
system as a whole will acquire a swing on the axis T U
(<a href="#ip_31">Fig. 31</a>) when the ship is steaming north—or south—and
rolling. Its period of vibration on this axis is not strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
that which it would have were it set oscillating about the
axis T U with this axis mounted on a fixed frame, for the
vibration is not a free one, but is a forced vibration under
the impulses communicated by the rolling of the ship.
Whatever may be the exact free period of swing of the
compass system on the axis T U, so long as it is somewhere
near that of the ship’s roll or a small sub-multiple
of the rolling period, the tendency is for the compass
swings to settle down in such a way that, as represented
in <a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>, the pendulum weight S reaches its extreme out
positions simultaneously with the ship’s arrival at its
extreme port and starboard heels. In the course of one
complete roll of the ship, however, the compass system
may make more than one complete vibration about T U.</p>

<p>It is clear that whether the bob S remains radially
below the centre of the wheel, as in <a href="#ip_32">Fig. 32</a>, or remains
vertically below it, or swings past the vertical, as in
<a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>, the effect of rolling when the ship is on a due
north course is as established in connection with <a href="#ip_29">Fig. 29</a>.
Either a tendency to rotate the wheel about an axis
coincident with its axle or an actual rotation of the wheel
about this axis results from the kicks of the weight S at
the out positions. Whichever it is, there is no gyroscopic
effect called into play, and the axle is not subjected to any
influence causing it to move away from the due north
direction.</p>

<p>We have now to discuss what happens if the vessel
rolls or pitches when sailing on an inter-cardinal or
quadrantal course.</p>

<p>In <a href="#ip_34">Fig. 34</a> we show in plan a vessel steaming on a north-west
course. When the ship rolls the compass oscillates
in the path A D, a path, that is to say, at right angles to
the ship’s centre line and curved upwardly by reason
of the fact that the compass is mounted above the rolling
centre of the ship. The axle of the compass during this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
movement tends to point steadily towards the north
under the action of the directive force. The wheel therefore
oscillates from A to D with its axle askew relatively
to the path of oscillation, and not at right angles to it, as
in <a href="#ip_29">Fig. 29</a>, or parallel with it, as in <a href="#ip_30">Fig. 30</a>. The oscillation
A D can, however, be resolved into two components,
namely, a north and south oscillation D K, in which the
axle is parallel with the path, and an east and west
oscillation K A, in which it is at right angles to the path,
both paths being curved upwardly.</p>

<div id="ip_34" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_p101.jpg" width="441" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 34.</span> Ship Rolling on N.W. Course.</div></div>

<p>The oscillation D K, taken by itself, is clearly exactly
equivalent to that shown in <a href="#ip_30">Fig. 30</a>. The southward kick
of the weight at the “out position” D (<a href="#ip_34">Fig. 34</a>) just
neutralises the disturbing effect of the northward kick at
the “out position” K.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Similarly, the oscillation K A, taken by itself, is exactly
equivalent to that shown in <a href="#ip_29">Fig. 29</a> or its modification,
<a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>. The eastward kick of the weight at A and the
westward kick at K cannot do more than turn the mounting
round the axle of the spinning wheel. They do not
tend to change the direction of the axle.</p>

<p>Hence, taken separately, each component oscillation
D K and K A is without disturbing effect upon the
direction in which the axle is pointing. Taken together,
however, their united effect is not the sum of their separate
effects, as we might hastily assume. We must not suppose
that the north and south kicks proper to the north and
south component of the oscillation are without effect
upon the east and west component or vice versa. At the
out position D of the component oscillation K D the weight
is not only kicked southwards, but also receives a westward
kick from the other component oscillation A K. At
K it receives both a northward kick and an eastward
kick. Similarly, at the out position K of the component
oscillation A K the weight is kicked not only to the west
but also to the south, by virtue of the oscillation from
K to D. At the other out position A of this component
the weight is kicked eastwardly, and also to the north.
If we take cognisance of these additional kicks, we may
treat the component oscillations separately and add the
separate results to get the true effect of the actual
oscillation A D.</p>

<p>Returning, then, to <a href="#ip_30">Fig. 30</a>, let us suppose that in
the oscillation there shown, the equivalent of the component
K D, we apply a westward kick to the weight S
when the ship reaches its port out position—that is to
say, a kick out of the paper—and that at the starboard
out position it receives an eastward kick into the plane
of the paper. It is clear that these additional kicks do
nothing more than tend to rotate the wheel about its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
axle or an axis coincident or parallel with its axle. They
cannot therefore call any gyroscopic effect into action,
and as a result do not disturb the direction in which the
axle is pointing. The component oscillation D K, even
with the extra kicks added, is thus harmless.</p>

<p>Taking <a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a> rather than <a href="#ip_29">Fig. 29</a> as the equivalent
of the component oscillation A K, let us suppose that
at the port out position the weight is subjected to an
additional kick to the south—that is, into the plane
of the paper—and that at the starboard out position
it receives an extra kick to the north, or out of the plane
of the paper. The southward kick on the weight at the
port out position will tend to cause the end B of the
axle to turn down towards J, but, in accordance with
the fundamental gyroscopic rule, the actual motion of
the sensitive element will not be a rotation about the
axis E F, but a precession about the axis H J, the end B
of the axle moving in the direction K. Similarly, the
northward kick at the starboard out position will tend
to cause the end B of the axle to rise towards H, and will
therefore produce precession in the direction L. Now
these two precessional movements, K and L, can be
resolved into horizontal and vertical components N M and
Q P respectively, as shown separately, and of these
components it is clear that the movement N cancels the
movement Q. On the other hand, the two components
M and P are in the same direction, and therefore do not
cancel each other. Their effect is cumulative, and with
each succeeding roll the end B of the axle tends to rise
higher and higher in the true vertical plane B R. It may
be explained, perhaps, that this motion is possible, in
spite of the fact that there is no actual axis in the mounting
of the compass at right angles to the true vertical
plane, except at the instant when the compass is passing
through the even keel position in the course of its swing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
from side to side. As the rolling of the ship starting from
zero increases up to a more or less steady value, the
end B of the axle rises slowly at first and then at a constant
rate, as exaggerated at T. Such of this upward movement
as occurs while the compass is passing through the
even keel position can be effected by means of a rotary
motion purely about the axis E F. Elsewhere in the
swing of the compass from side to side it is accommodated
by a partial rotation on E F and a partial rotation about
H J. These two axes between them permit the end B
of the axle to rise in a vertical plane at any point of the
compass swing just as effectively as would an axis which
was at right angles to the vertical plane B R.</p>

<p>To appreciate the significance of this vertical rise of
the north end B of the axle, let us consider the condition
of the compass as it is passing through the even keel
position. The elevation of the end B out of the horizontal
plane causes the weight S to swing forward towards
the north, and therefore to apply a turning moment to
the spinning wheel about the axis E F. This turning
moment will tend to bring the end B down again to the
horizontal, but, as we know, the actual motion produced
will be a precession about the axis H J, the end B moving
<em>westwards</em>. Looking at <a href="#ip_34">Fig. 34</a>, it will thus be seen that
the net effect of the rolling of the ship is to deviate the
axle of the compass in the direction shown at V—that
is to say, in the direction required to set the plane of the
spinning wheel parallel with the plane of the rolling by
the shortest possible course—in our example by a rotation
westward through 45 deg. With the axle so deflected
the earth’s rotation, of course, calls a directive force
into play, tending to restore the axle to the north and
south line, but if the ship is rolling violently the deviating
force will be much stronger than the directive force
until a very considerable angle of deflection is reached.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
When the balance is struck, the axle settles down with
a steady deviation towards the west, which will remain
constant as long as the rolling is maintained. In practice
the violence of the rolling varies almost from roll to roll,
for it represents a conflict between the natural period of
rolling of the ship and the period of the waves. As a
consequence, the deviation of the compass varies somewhat
during the rolling, but it is always westwardly if
the course is in the north-west quadrant.</p>

<p>A little consideration will show that if the ship is
steaming towards the north-east the additional kick
on the weight S (<a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>) at the port out position will
be towards the north and at the starboard out position
towards the south. The end B of the axle is therefore
precessed vertically downwards instead of upwards,
and as a result the deviation of the axle is <em>eastwardly</em>.
In general, if the ship is steaming on any course in the
north-west or south-east quadrant, the deviation caused
by her rolling will be towards the west. It will be towards
the east if the course is in the north-east or south-west
quadrant. The effect of pitching on a quadrantal course
is to cause a deviation of the axle in the direction opposed
to that of the deviation caused by rolling, so that if the
vessel be both rolling and pitching, the deviation is somewhat
less than it would be if rolling only had to be considered.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be thought that the quadrantal error
is an effect produced by the double gimbal mounting
of the compass, and that had we adhered to our simple
model, as shown in <a href="#ip_32">Fig. 32</a>, it would not arise. This is
not so. If <a href="#ip_32">Fig. 32</a> be taken as representing, after the
manner of <a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>, the north view of the compass on a
ship steaming due north-west, it will be seen that the
southern kick at the port out position causes the axle
to precess in the direction K and the northern kick at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
starboard out position in the direction L. Resolving
these movements as before, we see that, while the horizontal
components N Q again cancel, the vertical components
M P are, as in <a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>, cumulative in effect, but
this time they result in the end B of the axle moving
downwards, and therefore finally cause it to precess
eastwards instead of westwards, as before. The quadrantal
error is therefore not eliminated, but merely
reversed in direction by adopting the simpler mounting
for the compass.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ELIMINATION OF THE QUADRANTAL ERROR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">From</span> our description of the cause of the quadrantal
error it should be clear that it is of a variable erratic
nature, or at least that, unlike the latitude and north
steaming errors, its magnitude cannot be forecast from
a knowledge of the ship’s speed, course, latitude, or other
factors. Its direction is determined by the direction of
the ship’s course, but its amount is settled by the violence
of the rolling and pitching, and cannot therefore be calculated
and tabulated in a practically useful way. It
follows, therefore, that to get rid of the upsetting influence
of the quadrantal error we cannot resort to “correcting”
the compass readings for it, but must entirely eliminate it.</p>

<p>In the early (1910) Anschütz compass there were no
means of eliminating the quadrantal error, for the
existence of the error, or at least the importance to be
attached to it, was not at first recognised. The compass,
we believe, showed errors from this cause of as much as
20 deg. to 40 deg. As a result, within a very short time
the design was discarded, and what amounted to an
entirely different compass was substituted for it. The
1912 Anschütz compass will be briefly described later on,
but here it may be said that the quadrantal error in it is
eliminated by adding two more gyro-wheels to the sensitive
element. The theory of this compass is not very
easy to understand, so that it will be best if we explain
first how the quadrantal error is eliminated in the Sperry
and the Brown compasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
The early Sperry, like the early Anschütz compass,
was open to the full action of the quadrantal error.
In the form now in use, however, it is prevented from
taking effect by controlling automatically the position
of the excentric pin connecting the weight or “bail”
to the gyro casing. In the Sperry compass, as we know,
the weight S (<a href="#ip_35">Fig. 35</a>) is not hung from the inner supporting
ring or its equivalent, but from the follow-up or
phantom ring, its pendulous effect being communicated
to the casing and thence to the spinning wheel through
the excentric pin A. The kicks of the weight at the out
positions during the rolling of the ship are also transmitted
through the pin to the casing and wheel inside it.</p>

<div id="ip_35" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 35.</span> Sperry Compass on N.W. course.</div></div>

<p>Let us suppose, as shown in <a href="#ip_35">Fig. 35</a>, that at the port
out position of the compass swing the excentric pin is
<em>east</em> of the axis H J by the amount required just to bring
it vertically below the centre of the spinning wheel.
Then the southward kick of the weight when the vessel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
rolls on a north-west course is transmitted to the casing
as a southward force applied at the point A. This force,
acting about the axis E F as before, produces precession
in the direction K, and, as before, we may resolve this
movement into the components N M. The force at A
has, however, in addition, a turning moment about the
axis H J, for it is applied to the casing at a point lying
at a distance A D from this axis, and not, as in <a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>,
at a point virtually on it. This moment about H J
would tend to make the end B of the axle turn in the
direction of F, and therefore results, in accordance with
the rule of the gyroscope, in an actual movement about
the axis E F, the end B of the axle precessing downwards
towards J, that is, in the direction R. We may resolve
the precession R into two components T U.</p>

<p>Similarly, at the starboard out position, let us suppose
that the excentric pin is this time <em>westwards</em> of the axis
H J by exactly the amount required again to bring it
vertically below the centre of the wheel. As before,
in the case shown in <a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>, the northward kick of the
weight acting about E F results in a precession L, which
may be resolved into the components P Q. The kick,
however, as at the port out position, also has a moment
about the axis H J. The kick is reversed in direction,
but the point of its application to the casing is now on the
other side of H J. Consequently the kick tends to rotate
the casing about H J—and therefore produces precession
about E F—in the same direction as does the kick at
the port out position. The precession produced is
represented by V, and can be resolved into the components
W X.</p>

<p>Considering now the four pairs of component precessions,
we see that they cancel out in pairs. Thus
N and Q cancel, U cancels X, T wipes out M, and W
does the same to P. The two components M P, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
were the cause of the quadrantal error, are just balanced
by the two additional components T W. The axle therefore
does not rise vertically, but remains horizontal,
and as a result no quadrantal error can arise.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the Sperry method of eliminating
the quadrantal error requires the excentric pin to be
movable relatively to the bail and casing. To be more
precise, while the casing, the bail, the phantom ring,
and all the other parts of the compass may swing round
the axle of the spinning wheel, or the external gimbal
axis coincident or parallel with the axle, matters have
to be arranged in such a way that when the ship rolls
the excentric pin shall not partake of this motion, but
remain constantly in the vertical below the centre of the
spinning wheel. We have to remember, however, that the
Sperry method of damping the horizontal vibrations of
the axle hangs upon the pin being displaced towards the
east of the axis H J when the compass is in the even keel
position. The two requirements are met by so controlling
the position of the pin relatively to the bail and casing
that when the bail, casing, etc., swing sideways under the
influence of the rolling of the ship, the pin is maintained
at a fixed distance eastwards of the true vertical through
the centre of the spinning wheel at all points in the oscillation
of the bail, casing, etc.</p>

<div id="ip_36" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27.5em;">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 36.</span> Sperry Ballistic Gyro.</div></div>

<p>The stabilisation of the excentric pin in this manner
is effected gyroscopically by means of the attachment
shown in <a href="#ip_36">Fig. 36</a>. This device consists of a small high-speed
electrically driven gyroscope running inside a
casing which is mounted rotatably on a vertical axis
inside a stirrup frame. This frame, as shown in <a href="#ip_37">Fig. 37</a>,
is hung pendulum-wise on the north side of the main
gyro casing, the axis of its suspension being collinear with
the axle of the main gyro-wheel. The axle of the small
gyro-wheel is thus aligned in the east and west direction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
The stirrup bracket is turned up horizontally below the
casing of the small gyro, and at its end is fitted with
guides, carrying a pair of rollers. These rollers constitute
the excentric pin and, as shown in <a href="#ip_37">Fig. 37</a>, engage within
two curved channel-sectioned tracks attached one to the
bail and one to the main gyro casing. If when the bail,
casing, etc., swing under the influence of the ship’s
rolling the excentric pin should attempt to follow suit—either
by reason of friction at the axis of suspension of
the stirrup bracket or at the track rollers—the wheel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
and casing of the small gyro will start processing round
the vertical axis inside the stirrup, for the attempt is
equivalent to an endeavour to tilt the small gyro-axle
in an east and west vertical plane, and therefore calls
forth the usual gyroscopic reaction. The precession of
the small gyro on its vertical axis is made to react on the
stirrup bracket by means of a spring connection between
the bracket and the casing, as shown in <a href="#ip_36">Fig. 36</a>. The
direction of spin of the small gyro-wheel is such that the
force thus applied to the stirrup bracket opposes and just
balances the frictional or other force trying to make
it swing with the bail, casing, etc., of the main gyro.
In this way the excentric pin as the vessel rolls is caused
to maintain its original distance from the vertical line
through the centre of the spinning wheel.</p>

<p>The suppression, or rather the avoidance of the quadrantal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
error in the Brown compass, is achieved in a
manner which is mechanically very distinct from that
adopted for the same purpose in the Sperry compass.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 38.</span> Diagram of Brown Compass.</div></div>

<p>An elementary diagram of the Brown compass is given
in <a href="#ip_38">Fig. 38</a>. In this sketch A is the casing, inside which
the gyro-wheel mounted on the axle B (C) rotates in the
direction of the dotted arrow—B, as before, representing
the north-seeking end of the axle. The casing is supported
on an east and west horizontal axis E F inside a vertical
ring, this ring being journalled at H J inside a frame D,
the equivalent of the square frame in our simple model.
To obtain complete freedom for the gyro the frame D<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
is mounted on an athwartship axis G K, which is itself
carried inside a ring journalled within the binnacle on an
axis L parallel with the ship’s longitudinal centre line.
The pendulum weight S is fixed to the lowest point of
the frame D. If the weight S and frame D be set swinging
on the axis G K, the swinging movement will, of course,
be directly communicated through the journals H J to
the vertical supporting ring, but, as the trunnions E F of
the casing are really supported on knife edges, the swinging
movement of the frame D cannot be communicated from
the vertical ring through the trunnions E F to the casing
A, and thence to the wheel. Yet it is essential that the
weight S should be able to act pendulum-wise on the
casing and wheel, for otherwise, as we know, the system
would be without directive force.</p>

<div id="ip_39" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_p115.jpg" width="348" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 39.</span> Oil Control Bottles (Brown Compass).</div></div>

<p>The connection between the weight and the casing is
not a mechanical one, but is effected by making use of the
air blast created by the fan-like action of the wheel inside
the casing. As we have explained in connection with the
damping system adopted in this compass, the trunnion
F is hollow, and delivers the air blast through a nozzle M,
fixed relatively to the vertical supporting ring, into a
divided box N. From this box pipes are led to two oil
bottles—one of which is shown at P—fixed to the casing
on the east side of the axle, one bottle being on the north
face of the casing and the other on the south. The
pressure of the air blast acting unequally upon the oil in
these two bottles when the casing tilts about the axis E F
results, as we have already explained, in any horizontal
oscillation of the sensitive element about the axis H J
being damped. In a similar way two bottles Q R half-filled
with oil are fixed to the north and south faces of the
casing on the west side of the axle of the spinning wheel.
These bottles are also connected to the box N, but the
connecting pipes are crossed so as to join each bottle Q R<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
to the division of the box remote from it, and not to the
adjacent division, as in the case of the damping bottles P.
When, therefore, the weight S and frame D are swung
slowly pendulum-wise on the axis G K, as shown in the
first view in <a href="#ip_39">Fig. 39</a>, the nozzle M, being fixed to the
vertical ring, delivers more air into one division of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
box N than the other, and therefore a greater air pressure
is exerted inside one bottle than inside the other. Consequently
oil flows through the connecting pipe T from the
former bottle to the latter until the columns of oil are
sufficiently unequal to balance the difference of pressure
of the air inside the bottles. It will be noticed that the
crossing of the pipes connecting the bottles with the box
N results in the oil being accumulated in that bottle,
which lies away from the side to which the weight S has
been swung. Hence, although there is no mechanical
connection between the weight and the casing of the
spinning wheel, the effect when the weight S is swung
slowly is thus substantially the same as it would be if
there were, for the weight of the extra oil forced into the
bottle R exerts a turning moment on the casing about the
axis E F, and tends therefore to make the casing follow
the deflection of the weight S and frame D.</p>

<p>Similarly, should the axle B C dip, as shown in the
second view in <a href="#ip_39">Fig. 39</a>, extra oil will accumulate in the
bottle which has been elevated by the dipping, and as a
result a restoring moment about the axis E F will be
applied to the casing, just as it would be if the weight S
had been directly connected to the casing and had been
deflected by the dipping movement.</p>

<p>The second view in <a href="#ip_39">Fig. 39</a> illustrates the generation
of the directive force in the Brown compass. Let us
suppose that the compass is at the equator, and that by
some agency the axle is turned so that its end B points
due west. The rotation of the earth will cause the axle
to dip slowly into some such position as that shown.
During this slow dipping movement oil will flow slowly
from the bottle Q into the bottle R. The unbalanced
weight of oil will apply a turning moment to the sensitive
element about the axis E F and will therefore produce
actual motion about the axis H J, which will precess the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
end B of the axle towards the north. Any tendency for
the axle to vibrate about the north and south line as a
result of the momentum acquired by the sensitive
element while coming up from the west will be damped
by the air blast acting upon the oil in the two other
bottles P fixed, as shown in <a href="#ip_38">Fig. 38</a>, on the east side of the
axle.</p>

<div id="ip_40" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p117.jpg" width="600" height="539" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 40.</span> Brown Compass on West Course.</div></div>

<p>The point we require here to notice especially about
this action is that, as the tilting of the axle produced
by the rotation of the earth takes place very slowly—it
cannot exceed the speed of rotation of the earth on
its polar axis, namely, 0.0007 of a revolution per minute—the
flow of oil from the bottle Q to the bottle R takes
place very slowly also. The oil therefore acquires
practically no momentum, and rises in the bottle R in
strict accordance with the tilt acquired by the axle. If
the tilting motion be stopped or reversed, the oil would
remain in the bottle R at just the level it had reached, or
would immediately begin to flow back again, for its
momentum being negligible, it has not sufficient kinetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
energy to rise higher in the bottle R after the upward
motion of the bottle has ceased.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the ship rolls, say, on a due
west course, as represented in <a href="#ip_40">Fig. 40</a>, the outer gimbal
ring supporting the athwartship axis G K, the frame D
carrying the weight S, and the vertical supporting ring
will acquire an oscillation about the fore and aft axis L in
tune with the rolls of the ship. The air blast will thus be
directed into the two divisions of the box alternately, and
therefore oil will flow from one bottle to the other. It is
to be noticed, however, that the rolling motion of the ship
induces in this manner a flow of oil from one bottle to the
other at a very much greater rate than does the tilting
action of the earth’s rotation dealt with above.</p>

<p>A ship rolling through 45 deg., out to out, in a complete
period of 10 seconds rotates about its rolling centre
with an average velocity equivalent to 1.5 revolutions
per minute—or over 2000 times as fast as the speed of
rotation of the earth on its polar axis—and at the mid
point of its roll it will move with an actual velocity of
about twice the average. The momentum acquired by
the oil in flowing from bottle to bottle is therefore in this
case not negligible. In fact, when the ship reaches one of
its out positions and starts to return, the oil does not
immediately begin to flow back into the other bottle, but
is carried by its kinetic energy to a still higher level in the
bottle in which it has been rising. As a result, the oscillation
of the oil between the two bottles lags behind the
oscillation of the pendulum weight S, and therefore that
of the ship itself. The lag acquired is such that the oil is
just level in the two bottles when the ship is at either of
its out positions, and when the ship is at the mid point, or
even keel position of its roll, although the air blast is for
the moment evenly distributed between the two compartments
of the divided box, the oil is standing at its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
maximum level in the bottle on that side of the wheel
from which the ship is recovering herself. The action of
the oil in the bottles during a rapid oscillation of the
compass system is, in fact, quite analogous to that of the
water in the Frahm system of anti-rolling tanks.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the net effect of transmitting
the “kicks” derived during rolling from the pendulous
weight of the wheel through the Brown oil bottle arrangement
is simply to delay the application of the kicks to the
gyro-wheel by a constant amount, namely, by the time
taken for the ship to roll from either out position to the
mid position or a quarter of a complete period. Thus as
the ship sailing due west rolls through the mid position
from starboard to port the compass system experiences
the turning moment about the axis E F, which with a
rigidly fixed pendulum it would receive at the starboard
out position from the northwards kick of the weight.
Similarly, the equivalent of the southwards kick of the
weight at the port out position is felt by the wheel when
the compass is passing through the even keel condition on
the subsequent roll from port to starboard. It is clear
that with the ship sailing due west—or east—this delaying
of the kick does not affect the result established previously
for a rigidly connected pendulous weight. Any tendency
for the axle to precess towards the west when the compass
is passing through the even keel position in one direction
is completely annulled by the tendency to precess towards
the east at the succeeding passage through the even keel
position in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>On quadrantal courses, however, the delay in the
application of the kick is most important, for when the
ship rolls it results in the elimination of the quadrantal
error. That it does so can easily be understood by reference
to <a href="#ip_33">Fig. 33</a>. The kicks, being received when the
compass is passing through the even keel position, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
at the out positions, precess the wheel about the axis H J
at a time when this axis is truly vertical, and not when it
is inclined. The precessional movements have therefore
no vertical components M P. They are represented
completely by the horizontal components N Q. The
axle thus does not depart from the horizontal plane, and
any movements in this plane arising from the tendency
to precess in the directions N Q cancel each other at successive
passages of the compass through the mid position.</p>

<p>The early form of Anschütz compass was followed by
the 1912 pattern in which the quadrantal error was
successfully eliminated. An example of the 1910 form
was obtained by Messrs. Elliott Brothers, of Lewisham,
from Anschütz and Co., of Kiel, and was, we believe,
fitted on board H.M.S. <i>New Zealand</i>. Its defects becoming
apparent, its manufacture in this country was not
proceeded with, but upon the appearance of the improved
type in 1912, Messrs. Elliott took up its construction and
supplied several to the Admiralty. The Sperry compass,
however, secured the preference in the British Navy, and
with the outbreak of the war Messrs. Elliott ceased
practically to make Anschütz compasses. On the other
hand, the German Navy continued to use the 1912 type
of Anschütz compass, with very little alteration or
addition, right throughout the war. In view of the fact
that every German submarine was fitted with a compass
of this form, and bearing in mind the high degree of
excellence attained in the navigation of the enemy’s
underwater craft, there can be no doubt that the modern
Anschütz compass is a very satisfactory device.</p>

<p>In <a href="#ip_41">Fig. 41</a> we give a purely diagrammatic representation
of the compass. The outer square frame may, as usual,
be regarded as mounted within external gimbal rings,
providing a fore-and-aft axis and an athwartship axis.
The square frame contains a vertical ring free to turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
about the axis H J and itself containing a horizontal ring
mounted on an east and west axis F E. The pendulum
weight S is attached, as usual, to the inner horizontal
ring. The essential difference between the 1912 and the
1910 forms of Anschütz compass lies in the fact that, as
shown in our diagram, the inner ring, or its equivalent,
does not surround a single gyro-wheel, but has attached
to it the casings of three distinct gyros.</p>

<p>As shown in the first plan—in <a href="#ip_42">Fig. 42</a>—the three gyros
are situated at the corners of an equilateral triangle. One
gyro K is placed at the south end of the meridional

their axes pointing towards the centre of the gyro K—<em>not</em>
towards the centre of the ring. The wheels of all three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
gyros rotate anti-clockwise, as seen from the north, looking
south—that is, they rotate in the same direction as
do the wheels of all single-gyro compasses as seen from the
same standpoint.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 42.</span> Plans of Gyros.</div></div>

<p>If we neglect the two gyros L M for the moment,
imagining them to be replaced by simple deadweights
to counterbalance the weight of the gyro K, it will be
seen that this system differs from that of the early
Anschütz compass only in the fact that the gyro-wheel
has been reduced in size, and has been displaced from
the centre of the horizontal ring to the southern edge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
The displacement of the wheel in this manner in no way
affects the essential working of the compass. In a single-gyro
compass we might with some advantage similarly
displace the spinning wheel, for by so doing and by
counterbalancing the displaced weight we should, at least
partially, get rid of the concentration of mass about
the east-west axis, which, as we shall see, introduces,
if not corrected, an additional source of error into
the compass readings when the ship rolls on quadrantal
courses.</p>

<p>The reduction in the size of the gyro-wheel would, of
course, reduce the magnitude of the directive force. In
the 1912 design the wheels of all three gyros run at
20,000 revolutions per minute—that is, at the same speed
as the wheel in the 1910 design. But each wheel is only
5 in. in diameter instead of 6 in., and weighs, with its axle,
5 lb. 2 oz., or only half as much as the wheel in the earlier
form. The gyro K considered alone would therefore
supply a directive force of but half the former
amount.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>It follows, obviously, that if a second gyro of the same
speed and size as that at K be fixed in accurate alignment
at the north end of the meridional diameter of the
horizontal ring the directive force at any angle of horizontal
deflection away from the north will be doubled,
that is, will be made equal to that developed in the 1910
design. Such a compass might be constructed, but it
would exhibit the quadrantal error—or at least the inertia
force portion of that error—just as badly as did the early
Anschütz.</p>

<p>The essence of the 1912 design lies in the fact that not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
one but two gyros are attached to the north side of the
horizontal ring, and in the additional fact that the axles
of these two gyros are not parallel with but are inclined
to the axle of the south gyro K.</p>

<p>When the sensitive element of this compass is in the
north resting position, the axle of the gyro K is aligned
with the meridian and therefore the rotation of the earth—the
compass being supposed at the equator—merely
moves the axle parallel with itself. On the other hand,
with the sensitive element in the north resting position,
the axles of the gyros L M are inclined to the meridian at
30 deg. The gyro L is virtually in the condition of a
single-gyro compass, with the north end of its axle
partially turned towards the east. Under this condition,
as we know, the rotation of the earth will tend to make
the north end B of the axle rise above the horizontal plane.
Conversely, the gyro M is in the condition of a single-gyro
compass, with the north end of its axle partially
turned towards the west. The earth’s rotation in this
case tends to make the north end of the axle dip below the
horizontal plane. Thus, in the 1912 Anschütz compass,
when the sensitive element is in the north resting position,
the gyro K under the rotation of the earth is without
effect on the pendulous weight S, the gyro L is striving to
swing it towards the north, and the gyro M is trying with
an equal effort to swing it towards the south. The weight,
therefore, remains in the plumb line and applies no
turning moment to any of the gyros. As there is no
turning moment, there is no precessional tendency. The
sensitive element remains directed towards the north.
This alignment, as in a single-gyro system, is the true
resting position, and under it no directive force is applied
to the sensitive element.</p>

<p>To study how the three gyros act together to restore
the sensitive element to the north resting position should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
it be deflected therefrom, let us suppose that the deflection
suffered is one of 30 deg. towards the east. As shown in
the second plan in <a href="#ip_42">Fig. 42</a>, the effect of such a deflection
is to place the three gyros K L M in the condition respectively
of a single-gyro system when the axle is (<i>k</i>) deflected
30 deg. to the east, (<i>l</i>) deflected 60 deg. to the east, and
(<i>m</i>) aligned on the north. At this deflection, then, the
gyro M contributes no restoring force. The directive
force contributed by the gyro K is half that contributed
by the single gyro of the 1910 design when the deflection
is 30 deg., for the mass—or moment of inertia—of the
wheel is half the earlier value. The directive force contributed
by the gyro L is something greater than that
contributed by the gyro K, for the virtual deflection eastwards
is 60 deg. instead of 30 deg., and, as we know, the
directive force increases with the deflection. Thus, the
three gyros taken together supply a directive force, when
the sensitive element is deflected through 30 deg., which
is somewhat greater than that supplied by the single
double-sized wheel of the 1910 design.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> This result is
a general one. Whatever the deflection may be, the
directive force supplied by the three-gyro compass is
always about one-third greater than the directive force
of the 1910 design at the same deflection. This increased
force is developed even if the deflection be less than
30 deg. In such cases the gyro M will, of course, supply a
force, a non-restoring force, to the sensitive element. Only
when the deflection exceeds 30 deg. eastwards does the
gyro M assist the gyros K and L to restore the sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
element to the north resting position. If the deflection be
to the west, however, the gyro M is the chief assistant of
the gyro K, a laggard’s part being played by the gyro L
until 30 deg. of westerly deflection is reached.</p>

<p>The manner in which this three-gyro system avoids
the quadrantal error can now be discussed. The
quadrantal error, it may be recalled, arises when the ship
rolls on an intercardinal course, and is primarily caused
by the fact that the whole compass system can swing on
its external gimbal axis in tune with the rolls of the ship.
If we could so arrange matters that during the roll of the
ship from side to side the compass system would swing on
the external gimbals, no more and no less than the amount
required just to keep the axis H J truly vertical at all
points of the roll, then the north and south “kicks”
received on the weight S at the out positions of the roll
would cause the sensitive element to precess first one way,
then the other, but always in a horizontal plane. There
would be no vertical component in the precession, the
cumulative effect of which, as we have seen, produces the
quadrantal error.</p>

<p>In the Brown compass, the quadrantal error is eliminated
by delaying the effect of the “kicks” on the weight
S until the axis H J is truly vertical—that is to say, the
“kicks” on the weight are not transmitted to the spinning
wheel until the compass system is passing through the
even keel position. In the Sperry compass the weight S
is virtually shifted back and forth from east to west of the
axis H J in tune with the rolling of the ship in such a way
as to introduce a second component of vertical precession,
which in amount and direction is just sufficient to
nullify the vertical component causing the quadrantal
error. In the 1912 Anschütz compass, the object aimed
at is the maintenance of the axis H J truly vertical at all
times during the rolling condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
This object is achieved, as we shall now show, by
setting the axles of the gyros L M—<a href="#ip_41">Fig. 41</a>—inclined
to the axle of the gyro K. In a single-gyro compass,
or in the 1912 Anschütz compass with the gyros L M
suppressed, the system is very stiff against vibrations on
the east-west axis E F, but is quite easily set vibrating
about the north-south axis provided by the external
gimbal mounting. The reason is, of course, that any
vibration about the axis E F is met by the resistance of the
gyro-wheel, for the vibration causes the axle to alter its
direction, whereas no gyroscopic resistance is called into
play by the vibration on the north and south axis, for this
axis is coincident or parallel with the gyro-axle. Thus,
in the 1910 Anschütz compass the period of vibration
about the east-west axis was something like 70 min.,
whereas the period about the north and south axis was
only one or two seconds. The smallness of the latter
period readily resulted in the compass system getting
into a swing in tune with the period of rolling of the ship—from
five to twelve seconds or so. Were the axles of the
gyros L M in the 1912 form set parallel with that of the
gyro K, there would still be no gyroscopic resistance
exerted against vibration on the north-south axis. As it
is, the inclination of the axles of these two gyros, taken
together, has virtually the same effect as would be
obtained by the addition to the sensitive element of a
separate single gyro, with its axle aligned at right angles
to the axle of the gyro K.</p>

<p>The gyroscopic stiffness against vibration about the
east-west axis E F is hardly affected by the inclination
of the gyros L M at the angle chosen by the designers.
The resistance, instead of being that contributed by three
gyros, is equivalent to that supplied by about 2¾ gyros.
The period of vibration on this axis E F is arranged to be
the standard 85 min. About the north and south axis we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
have virtually the resistance of one gyro. The period of
vibration about this axis, instead of being only one
or two seconds, is about 80 sec. With this lengthened
period of vibration there is practically no chance of the
compass system getting into a swing in tune with the
rolling of the ship, for every 2½ to 6 seconds the vibrating
influence is reversed in direction, and in this interval of
time the system cannot acquire any substantial degree of
swinging motion. Thus, as the compass, following the
rolls of the ship, moves from side to side, it suffers a pure
translational movement. The axis H J remains truly
vertical at all instants during the roll, and therefore the
north and south kicks of the pendulous weight at the out
positions of the roll precess the gyro-axle about H J in
purely a horizontal plane, the precessional tendency at
one out position cancelling that at the other. There is no
vertical component in the precession, and therefore there
can be no quadrantal error.</p>

<p>It is of interest and of some amusement to note that
during the war the Germans applied a fourth gyro to the
Anschütz compass, and that this additional gyro was
carefully removed from every compass before they surrendered
their submarines to us. The deceit was,
however, of no avail, for the application of the fourth
gyro was known to us long before the war ended, a
complete compass so fitted having been recovered from a
sunken submarine and repaired and carefully studied.
The fourth gyro was applied to the external gimbal rings.
These rings, when the submarine rolled, were found to
acquire at times a violent oscillation of their own, for, of
course, they received no stabilisation from the gyroscopic
elements of the compass. On board submarines the
violence with which the rings vibrated would occasionally
threaten to wreck the compass. By adding a gyroscope
to the gimbal rings, the period of vibration of the rings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
was lengthened to about 16 sec., so that little or no
opportunity to swing was left to them. With the exception
of this addition, the Anschütz 1912 compass was
used by the Germans throughout the war practically
without alteration.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">In</span> addition to the “kicks” of the pendulous weight,
which during quadrantal rolling, as we have seen, react
gyroscopically upon the compass and tend to make the
axle deviate from the north, there is a second influence
at work on the compass, which, when the vessel rolls on an
intercardinal course, likewise tends to deviate the axle.
The two deviations are always in the same direction, so
that we cannot arrange the one to reduce or eliminate the
other. The second deviation arises from the centrifugal
forces developed in the compass parts during quadrantal
rolling. These forces, like the kicks of the pendulous
weight, react gyroscopically upon the spinning wheel, and
if not checked will deviate the axle away from the north.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 43.</span> Centrifugal Forces on a Pendulum.</div></div>

<p>Let us consider the somewhat unusual type of pendulum
shown in <a href="#ip_43">Fig. 43</a>, a pendulum the rod A of which is fixed
rigidly to the bar B carried on knife edges, and of which
the “bob” is in the form of a cylinder suspended at its
mid point from the rod A in such a way as to permit the
bob to turn horizontally on the bearing at C, substantially
without friction. In the first instance, let the pendulum
be set swinging about the knife edges with the cylindrical
bob set parallel with the axis B. Each portion of the bob
is thus caused to swing about that point on the axis B
which is vertically over the portion when the bob is at
rest. The centrifugal force developed on each portion is
at all positions of the swing directed radially from such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
point. The centrifugal force on each portion is a maximum
when the bob is passing through the mid position,
and falls, with the velocity, to zero at each of the out
positions. At the mid position the centrifugal force on
the two extreme portions L M of the bob may be represented
by D E. These two forces are equal and are
directed vertically downwards. On all other similar
portions the centrifugal force at the same instant is
similar in magnitude and direction. The net effect of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
centrifugal forces on all the portions is thus simply a
tendency to bend the bob ends downwards about the
central line at C. They have clearly no tendency either
at the mid position of the swing or at any other to turn
the bob round the axis C at the foot of the rod.</p>

<p>Let us now set the pendulum swinging with the bob
arranged at right angles to the knife-edge axis, as shown
in the second view of <a href="#ip_43">Fig. 43</a>. Each and every portion of
the bob is now swinging about the one point F on the axis.
At any instant in the swing the centrifugal force on any
portion is directed along the line joining the point F to the
centre of that portion. Taking the two extreme end
portions L M as the bob passes through the mid position,
the centrifugal forces are as indicated at G H. They are
not now vertical nor parallel with each other, but, again,
they have no tendency to turn the bob horizontally about
the axis at C. Resolving them into vertical and horizontal
components, we see that the net effect of all the centrifugal
forces is to try to bend the ends of the bob downwards—the
effect of the vertical components—combined
with the application to the bob of a horizontal stretching
force—the effect of the horizontal components.</p>

<p>Let us, however, rotate the bob about the axis at C
through something less than 90 deg. from the first
position—say, through 45 deg., as indicated in the third
sketch. Consider again the two extreme end portions as
the bob is passing through the mid position of its swing.
Let J K be a line through the centre of the bob parallel
with the knife-edge axis. From the centres of the end
portions, let lines L N and M P be drawn at right angles
to J K. From N and P draw lines upwards parallel with
the rod A to meet the knife-edge axis at Q and R. Then
Q and R are the points about which the two extreme
portions of the bob are swinging. The centrifugal forces
on these portions are directed along the lines Q L and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
R M, and are indicated at S and T. These forces may, as
shown, be resolved into vertical components—parallel
with Q N and R P—and horizontal components—parallel
with N L and P M. Treating the other portions of the
bob similarly, it will be seen that while the vertical components
of the centrifugal forces, as before, merely tend
to bend the ends of the bob downwards, the horizontal
components are no longer parallel with the length of the
bob, as in the second sketch. They are inclined to the bob
and clearly apply to it a moment which will turn it about
the axis at C in the direction of the arrow U until the bob
reaches the position shown in the second sketch.</p>

<p>It is obvious that any rotation of the bob on the axis
at C away from the position shown in the first sketch,
even a slight one, will call into action horizontal components
of centrifugal force after the manner shown in the
third sketch. The equilibrium of the bob in the position
shown in the first sketch is therefore unstable. With the
bob in the second position a movement of the end L to the
<em>left</em> will, as we know, call into action horizontal components
of centrifugal force, tending to turn the bob about
C in the direction of the arrow U. If the end L is moved
to the <em>right</em> the horizontal components, as can easily be
verified by repeating the argument, will tend to turn the
bob about C in the direction opposed to the arrow U.
Thus deflection to either side of the second position calls
forth forces which lead the bob to recover that position.
We conclude, therefore, that the second position is one of
stable equilibrium.</p>

<p>It may further be shown by repeating the argument
that if the bob is rotated about C from the first position
in such a way as to send the end L to the <em>rear</em> the horizontal
components called into action tend to set the bob
into the second position with the end L pointing <em>backwards</em>,
and that when the bob is so aligned relatively to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
the knife-edge axis the equilibrium is again stable. Thus,
altogether, if the bob is parallel with the knife-edge axis,
the equilibrium is unstable. If it is at right angles the
equilibrium is stable. If it is set into any intermediate
position, forces are called into play which endeavour to
align it at right angles to the knife-edge axis.</p>

<p>Let a second cylindrical bob of the same size and weight
be attached to the first at right angles to it and in the
same plane. Then in all positions of the bobs relatively
to the knife-edge axis the equilibrium will be stable, for
at any setting of the bobs the rotary force about C
developed by the one bob will be equal and opposed in
direction to that developed by the other bob.</p>

<p>The above discussion covers a principle of considerable
general importance in mathematical physics. Briefly
put, it shows us that a body suspended pendulum-wise in
the manner sketched will develop a tendency when swung
to set its longer axis parallel with the plane of the swing,
and that to avoid this tendency in a swinging body
mounted in the manner we have indicated, the mass of
the body must be distributed symmetrically and equally
about the pendulum rod, so that there shall be no “longer
axis.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> So far as the gyro-compass is concerned, the
circumstances described necessitate—at least in the
Sperry and Brown compasses—the addition of compensator
weights to represent the second cylindrical bob
to which we have referred above.</p>

<p>The masses composing the gyro-compass are not
disposed symmetrically and equally about the vertical
axis—the axis which we have throughout called H J.
As seen in plan, the masses are concentrated towards
the east and west plane containing the spinning wheel,
and are deficient towards the north and south. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
virtue of the presence of the pendulous weight, or its
equivalent, below the spinning wheel, the whole mass of
the compass is capable of swinging pendulum-wise, the
axis of this swing being one or other of the axes of the
external gimbal mounting. Further, the swinging mass
is free—if the wheel is not spinning—to turn about the
vertical axis which we have called H J. Reference to
<a href="#ip_31">Fig. 31</a> will make these statements quite clear.</p>

<p>Thus the compass and its system of mounting inevitably
reproduce the essential features of the pendulum
shown in <a href="#ip_43">Fig. 43</a>. Taking the second sketch in that
engraving, the bob represents the masses of the compass
concentrated in the east and west plane. The gyro-axle
being at right angles to this plane is parallel with the
knife-edge axis B. This axis B may be regarded as
representing the longitudinal axis of the external gimbal
mounting, so that in the conditions imagined the ship is
supposed to be sailing due north or south. It is clear that
when the ship rolls on either of these courses, the fact that
the mass of the compass is concentrated in the east and
west plane will not tend to deviate the axle, for the
“pendulum bob” is in its position of stable equilibrium.</p>

<p>The first sketch similarly represents the condition of
matters existing when the ship rolls on an east or west
course, the knife-edge axis B again being identified with
the longitudinal axis of the external gimbal mounting.
The pendulum bob is now in its position of unstable
equilibrium, so that if the mass distribution of the
compass is not corrected by the addition of compensator
weights, a tendency for the axle to deviate away from the
north <em>may</em> occur.</p>

<p>If we identify the knife-edge axis B with the athwartship
axis of the external gimbal mounting, the second
sketch in <a href="#ip_43">Fig. 43</a> illustrates the condition of matters
existing when the ship <em>pitches</em> on an east or west course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
while the first will represent pitching on a due north or
south course.</p>

<p>On quadrantal courses, failure to correct the inequality
of the mass distribution, if that distribution is not
uniform, will <em>inevitably</em> result in the axle deviating when
the ship rolls. Thus, the third view in <a href="#ip_43">Fig. 43</a> represents
the conditions prevailing when the ship rolls on a due
north-west—or south-east—course. Looking at the plan,
the line J K represents the direction of the longitudinal
axis of the external gimbal mounting and therefore the
direction of the ship’s course, while a line at right angles
to the pendulum bob would represent the gyro-axle, and
therefore the north and south direction. When the ship
rolls the compass masses oscillate pendulum-wise about
the external longitudinal gimbal axis—represented by the
bar B—but the directive force of the compass tends to
preserve the general plane of the oscillating masses
inclined at 45 deg. to the direction of the bar B. As a
result, the horizontal components of the centrifugal forces
developed in the compass masses apply to the wheel,
casing, etc., a turning moment in the direction of the
arrow U. This moment, it will be seen, tends to turn the
sensitive element in the same direction as that in which
the “kicks” of the weight at the out positions of the
swing endeavour to deviate the axle on the same course.
The centrifugal moment would, however, cause an actual
deviation in the direction U in a direct manner only if the
gyro-wheel were not spinning. As it is, the centrifugal
moment causes the north end of the gyro-axle to precess
upwards and therefore leads to a deflection of the pendulous
weight of the north. This deflection throws a turning
moment on to the wheel about the horizontal axis—the
axis we have called E F throughout—and, finally, this
turning moment precesses the axle horizontally in the
direction of the arrow U. Thus, with the wheel spinning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
the centrifugal moment actually does produce rotation in
the direction U, but its action is not direct.</p>

<p>As we have said, the tendency of the axle to deviate
during rolling on quadrantal courses as a result of the
action of centrifugal forces, is corrected in those compasses
requiring it by the addition to the compass masses of
compensator weights on the north and south sides of the
sensitive element. These weights are adjusted for mass
and position in such a way as to make the mass distribution
of the sensitive element substantially the same in the
north and south direction as in the east and west. In this
way the centrifugal forces tending to cause deviation are
neutralised on all courses, both during rolling and
pitching.</p>

certain mechanical and electrical features of the principal
types of gyro-compass—features, that is, which, not being
primarily connected with the gyroscopic behaviour of the
compass, have not so far been mentioned in our discussion
of the general theory of the device.</p>

<p>A sectional diagrammatic view of the early form of
Anschütz compass is given in <a href="#ip_44">Fig. 44</a>. This compass,
although it is now obsolete by reason of the fact that no
provision was made in its design for the quadrantal error,
is still, we think, of interest from other than the historical
point of view.</p>

<p>The gyro-wheel is shown at A. The axle is carried in
bearings inside the casing B. This casing is attached to
a tubular stalk C, which is fixed to a head D carrying
the compass card R. This system of parts as a whole is
floated in mercury Q contained inside a circular steel
bowl K, the flotation being secured by means of a hollow
steel ring S joined to the head D by a dome-shaped
member E, which is perforated all over for the sake of
lightness. As the float S is completely immersed in the
mercury, the exact level to which it will sink can be
delicately settled by controlling the form of the bore
inside the head D. The central position of the float
inside the bowl is controlled by means of a steel stem T
fixed at its upper end to the centre of the glass G covering
the card and pointed at its lower end to dip into a cup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
containing mercury which is fixed centrally inside the
stalk C. The stem T is insulated, and is enclosed within
a tube, the upper end of which is also attached to the
glass G and the lower end of which is splayed out to dip
into a second mercury cup surrounding but insulated from
the first. Through this tube and its mercury cup one
phase of a three-phase current is led to the motor driving
the gyro-wheel from the terminal F. The second phase
reaches the motor from the terminal H by way of the
stem T, while the third phase is transmitted through the
bowl, the mercury Q, and the float. The bowl is provided
with knife-edge bearings at L, whereby the whole system
shown is mounted within two gimbal rings providing the
external longitudinal and athwartship axes. The outer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
gimbal ring is supported inside the binnacle by means of
springs, the attachments of these springs, as well as the
gimbal supports, being insulated on account of the
method adopted for transmitting the third phase of the
current to the gyro-motor. The gyro-axle runs on ball
bearings. The driving motor comprises a stator carrying
the windings and fixed inside the casing B and a rotor
forming a rigid part of the gyro-wheel itself.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this design of compass does not
explicitly reproduce the horizontal axis E F, nor the
pendulous weight S of our simple model. The float is,
however, free to tilt within the bowl in any direction, so
that the system of suspension is practically equivalent to
the provision of an infinite number of horizontal axes
E F. As regards the apparent absence of the pendulous
weight, it is to be noted that the centre of gravity of the
floating system is below its metacentre, and therefore
that the pendulum effect is exactly reproduced. The
damping details are not shown in the engraving, but they
are substantially as we have described them previously.</p>

<p>In view of the high speed, 20,000 revolutions per
minute, at which the gyro-wheel runs, giving a stress in
the rim of about 10 tons per square inch and a peripheral
velocity of 340 miles an hour, it is of interest to note that
during a test to destruction the wheel did not fail until it
was being driven at a speed involving the supply to it of
five times the normal driving power. A special motor
generator had to be built to enable this test to be carried
out. Even the normal motor driving the gyro-wheel had
to be specially designed, for no motor capable of running
at 20,000 revolutions was at the time commercially
available, while the small space within which it had to be
accommodated rendered the question of temperature rise
a very serious one. It was found, it may be added, that
in designing the motor the usually accepted magnetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
constants for the iron in the motor did not hold good with
a periodicity as high as 333 cycles per second.</p>

<p>The flotation of the sensitive element in mercury is a
simple and convenient method of obtaining a practically
frictionless support for the vertical axis—the axis H J of
our elementary model. The absence of friction arises from
the facts that the drag of the mercury on the parts of the
sensitive element with which it is in contact is proportional
to the velocity with which the parts move through it, and
that this velocity is always extremely slow. If the
mercury is freshly distilled, there is, it would appear,
substantial absence of frictional drag. But in course
of time dust, oil, etc., may collect on the surface of the
mercury, and may introduce a drag on the sensitive
element of sufficient amount to interfere with the accuracy
of the compass readings. The suspension of the vertical
axis by flotation has, however, the advantage that no
external gimbal rings need be provided to give the
sensitive element three degrees of freedom in all configurations.
The sensitive element, as we have said, is
virtually provided with an infinite number of horizontal
axes, so that within the bowl itself there is always a
longitudinal and an athwartship axis about which the
sensitive element may turn. The external gimbal axes
provided in this compass permit the bowl to remain
horizontal when the ship rolls or pitches; they are not
essential gyroscopically. A similar remark applies to the
later form of Anschütz compass in which the sensitive
element is also floated in mercury.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SPERRY COMPASS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">A general</span> view of the Sperry compass as removed from
the binnacle is given in <a href="#ip_45">Fig. 45</a>. This view depicts the
compass as it would be seen looking forward on a vessel
steaming towards the south-west. At A is shown the
compensator weight on the north side of the sensitive
element, and at B the ballistic gyro is to be seen. The
ring C is the inner of the two external gimbal rings, and
carries on an athwartship axis D the spider E, from which
the sensitive element is suspended. At F may be seen one
of the bearings whereon this ring is swung on a longitudinal
axis within the outer gimbal ring. The outer ring,
in turn, is hung on springs attached to the inside of the
binnacle. The speed and latitude corrector dials are to be
seen directly above the bearing F, while behind them the
inclined cosine ring or course corrector ring is visible. The
phantom ring is shown at G. This ring in section is
channel-shaped, and in the view hides the vertical ring
within which the casing of the gyro-wheel is journalled on
the horizontal east and west axis. It is to be carefully
noted that the lugs H, by which the compensator weights
are attached to the sensitive element, are not fixed to the
phantom ring, but pass through easy-fitting holes therein,
and are directly secured to the vertical ring inside. The
bail weight lies within the phantom and vertical rings,
and can be seen at J, the tracks for the excentric pin, one
on the bail and the other on the wheel casing, being shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
at K. The stirrups L are fixed to the ends of the bail, and
carry the pins whereon the bail is swung from the phantom
ring. The bail latitude corrector dial, whereby the bail
is allowed to assume the tilt appropriate to each latitude
without disturbing the horizontality of the gyro-axle, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
visible behind the stirrup. The horizontality of the axle
is indicated on a level attached at this point to two
brackets springing from the wheel casing.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 46.</span> The Sperry Compass.</div></div>

<p>Of the non-gyroscopic mechanical details of this
compass, chief interest probably centres in the method
of providing the vertical axis about which the sensitive
element may turn relatively to the spider E in a substantially
frictionless manner. In <a href="#ip_46">Fig. 46</a> we give a
diagram of the compass as we would see it looking aft on a
ship steaming due south. It will be seen from this diagram
that the phantom ring, shown in black section, is extended
at the top to form a horizontal flange. On this flange the
angular divisions of the compass card are engraved. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
phantom ring is also formed with a central hollow stalk
whereby it is hung on ball bearings within the central boss
of the spider. A torsionless wire composed of several
strands of steel is secured at one end to a cap fixed over
the top of the stalk, and at the lower end is secured to a
ball-borne pin forming part of the vertical ring. Diametrically
below, the vertical ring and the phantom are
united by a pivot pin. The gyro case, as we have
explained before, is carried on a horizontal axis within
the vertical ring, while the bail is swung on the phantom.
The phantom and all within it may be regarded as the
sensitive element, the constant alignment of which in the
north and south direction gives the device its utility as a
compass. The spider carrying the lubber ring and all
outside it move round the wire-and-pivot-pin vertical
axis with the ship when the course is altered. When such
a movement occurs the absence of any direct mechanical
connection of a rigid nature between the phantom ring on
the one hand and the rest of the sensitive element on the
other would tend to result in the phantom ring following
the movement of the spider, binnacle, and ship rather than
in its remaining stationary with the wheel, casing, and
vertical ring. The suspension wire would thus be twisted.
As we have previously explained, however, the phantom
ring is formed just below the card with a circular rack
with which there meshes a pinion driven through reduction
gearing by a small electric motor—the azimuth
motor—attached to the spider. The starting and
stopping of this motor and the direction of its rotation are
controlled automatically by means of gold-rimmed wheels
on two trolley heads fixed to the vertical ring and certain
gold-faced contactors on the phantom. Thus when the
ship’s course is altered the azimuth motor is started up in
the direction required to take the twist out of the suspension
wire and bring the phantom into alignment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
with the rest of the sensitive element. When this alignment
is reached the motor is automatically cut out. In
actual use the phantom overshoots the exact position of
alignment by a very small amount, bringing the reverse
contactors into action and starting the motor in the
reverse direction. The phantom, in fact, oscillates about
the position of alignment with the sensitive element
through, roughly, a quarter of a degree. This small
vibration is transmitted to the repeater compasses elsewhere
in the ship, and is of practical value in that its
visibility is some assurance that the master compass is
working correctly.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that the absence of friction about
the vertical axis of the Sperry compass is secured by
suspending the sensitive element within a member—the
phantom ring—the frictional drag on which is eliminated
by driving it by power in such a way that it follows all the
movements of the sensitive element relatively to the
supporting spider in an automatic and substantially
instantaneous and dead-beat manner.</p>

<p>The repeater compasses are operated electrically from
the master compass through a transmitter and a pinion
meshing with the circular rack on the phantom. The
pinion is journalled on a pin depending from the lubber
ring, and therefore transmits to the repeaters not only
the relative movement between the phantom and the
binnacle, but, as we have before explained, any movement
of the lubber ring relatively to the binnacle which
may be made to correct the reading of the master compass
for the latitude and north steaming errors. In this way
the repeater compasses always indicate true north both
for course-setting purposes and for the purpose of taking
bearings on passing objects. It is regarded as outside the
scope of this discussion to describe the mechanical
features of the repeater compasses. It may, however, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
remarked that the fact that they may be fitted in any
number and in any position, and that automatic course
recorders and similar devices may also readily be linked
up with the gyro-compass, forms a very strong reason in
itself for recommending the adoption of the gyroscopic
rather than the magnetic compass on board ship.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BROWN COMPASS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Brown compass is the invention of Mr. S. G. Brown,
F.R.S., of North Acton, with Professor John Perry,
F.R.S., in association as technical adviser and co-patentee.
It has been evolved after five years of laborious experimental
work, and is claimed to be the only British
gyroscopic compass so far constructed and applied on
board ship.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 49.</span> The Brown Compass.</div></div>

<p>In <a href="#ip_47">Fig. 47</a> we show the Brown compass as seen looking
forward on a vessel steaming due north. The south end
of the gyro-axle is pointing towards the reader. In
<a href="#ip_48">Fig. 48</a> it is shown as it would be seen when looking
forward on a vessel steaming due west. The north end of
the axle is pointing to the right in this view. In the line
engraving (<a href="#ip_49">Fig. 49</a>) we are supposed to be looking forward
on a vessel steaming due south. The north end of the
axle is therefore pointing toward us. In the half-tone
engravings the compass is shown removed from its
external gimbal rings. The axis A (<a href="#ip_47">Fig. 47</a>), it will be
understood, is the athwartship axis of the external
mounting. It is mounted on ball bearings within a
couple of small brackets which by means of four screws
are attached to the inner gimbal ring, as shown in <a href="#ip_49">Fig. 49</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
This inner ring, in turn, is carried on a longitudinal axis
inside an outer gimbal ring, which, finally, is hung on
springs from the binnacle. The frame B, within which the
sensitive element proper is mounted, is very much as we
have represented it to be in our previous diagrams,
except that it swings pendulum-wise on the axis A—or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
the other axis of the external mounting—not because of
the attachment to it at its lowest point of an actual bob
weight, but because its centre of gravity is designedly
below the axis of suspension, and because at its lowest
point it carries a casing containing an electric motor and
other adjuncts possessing a degree of weight.</p>

<p>As shown best in <a href="#ip_49">Fig. 49</a>, the frame B supports a
vertical ring C carrying the compass card, and within
which the casing D containing the gyro-wheel is mounted
on a horizontal, east and west, knife-edge axis. The
easterly end of this knife-edged axis—towards the left in
the engraving—has associated with it the nozzle and
divided air box, whereby, as we have explained, the
pressure of the air blast generated inside the casing by the
spinning wheel is transmitted by open and crossed pipes
respectively to the oil-damping bottles E and the oil
control bottles F.</p>

<p>What we regard as the most interesting non-gyroscopic
feature of the Brown compass is the manner in which the
vertical ring C is supported within the frame B. The ring
at its highest point is formed with a vertical trunnion,
which at its top is guided within a ball bearing fixed in
the central boss of the frame B. Three slip rings lower
down on the trunnion acting in conjunction with three
mercury contact rings attached to the frame serve to
conduct three-phase current to the sensitive element.
At the lower side the vertical ring is also provided with a
trunnion, which is of the nature of a foot-step bearing.
In reality, however, the trunnion is never allowed to touch
the bottom of its bearing, for it—and with it the vertical
ring, the compass card, and the whole of the sensitive
element—is forced, by means of a supply of oil delivered
below it, to vibrate up and down through about an eighth
of an inch at the rate of some 180 times a minute. Before
the trunnion can fall to the foot of its bearing it gets a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
fresh kick up by the oil, so that no actual metal-to-metal
contact is established. The oil supply is drawn from and
returned to the reservoir G by a pump driven from an
electric motor H. The slight rapid vibratory motion
thus communicated to the sensitive element has no
appreciable effect upon the ease or accuracy with which
the compass card may be read. On the other hand, it is
sufficient to relieve the frictional resistance to turning at
the upper and lower trunnions of the vertical ring in
accordance with the well-known fact that if we overcome
friction in one direction we overcome it also in the
direction at right angles to the first.</p>

<p>A second mechanical feature of the Brown compass of
outstanding interest is the method adopted for transmitting
the indications of the master compass card to the
repeater compasses. The problem to be solved in this
matter is to establish connection with the master compass
card in a manner which shall impose no frictional or other
drag on that card. To this end in the Brown compass the
air blast generated by the spinning wheel is called upon
to fulfil a function additional to those to which we have
already referred. The air blast is delivered not only from
the eastern, but also from the western end of the horizontal
axis of the casing. It is thus directed through a
nozzle J against the face of a contact maker K containing
a pair of disc-like plungers working in balanced connection
within two cylinders. Opposite each plunger is
a slot, and when no movement has to be transmitted
to the repeater compasses the air blast is directed against
the blank wall between these two slots or enters each
slot in equal proportion. Thus the plungers being
balanced, neither makes contact. If, however, the ship’s
course is altered, the contact maker K, being attached to
a ring L beneath the lubber ring, moves with the ship,
while the nozzle J remains stationary with the sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
element. Thus the air blast exerts unequal pressures on
the plungers, and one of them is forced back to make
contact. As a result, a step-by-step electric motor M
carried on the frame B and in mesh through reduction
gearing with a rack on the ring L is started up and turns
the ring in the direction required to make the two slots
again divide the air blast equally. When this neutral
position is reached the motor is cut out. As in the Sperry
compass, the follow-up motion is open to a little hunting
movement as a result of the momentum acquired by the
parts. Ignoring this hunting movement, the ring L and
the contact maker K are thus driven to remain stationary
in fixed relationship with the sensitive element no matter
to what extent the frame B may move with the ship when
the course is altered. The relative movement between
the ring L and the frame B is communicated to the
repeater compasses in an electrical manner. The details
of the electrical transmission are outside the ambit of this
discussion, but we may say that the movements communicated
to the repeater compasses are derived from a
distributor on the compass switchboard, this distributor
being arranged to operate in exact synchronism with the
follow-up ring L. It is claimed for the Brown system of
transmission between the master and the repeater
compasses that even should the whole repeater system
break down the correct action of the master compass will
not thereby be affected.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ANSCHÜTZ (1912) COMPASS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">A plan</span> and sectional elevation of the modern form of
Anschütz compass are given in Figs. <a href="#ip_50">50</a> and <a href="#ip_51">51</a>. The
casings of the three gyros K L M hang by vertical stalks
below a triangular spider A at the centre of which is
affixed a float B immersed in a bowl C containing mercury.
After the manner followed in the 1910 form, the float and
all attached to it are centralised relatively to the bowl by
means of a rod D fixed centrally to the cover of the
compass. As before, this rod D is composed of a central
core and a liner insulated from the core. The ends of the
core and liner dip into two concentric mercury cups
carried within the float in order that two phases of the
three-phase current driving the gyro-motors may be transmitted
through the core and liner of the rod D. The third
phase is transmitted through the mercury and float by
earthing the bowl C.</p>

<p>Matters are so arranged that the centre of flotation of
the float B and its attached parts is above the centre of
gravity of the floating parts. These floating parts—the
spider A, the float B, the three gyros, and other items not
yet mentioned—constitute the sensitive element, so that
this element, as in the 1910 form, does not need the
addition of a separate weight to provide the required
pendulum action about a horizontal axis through the
centre of flotation. Instead of there being but one such
horizontal axis—the east and west axis E F of our models
and diagrams—it is clear that the support of the sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
element by means of a float provides the element with an
east and west horizontal axis and an infinite number of
other horizontal axes.</p>

<div id="ip_50" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 36.6875em;">
  <img src="images/i_p155.jpg" width="587" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap rpad">Fig. 50.</span> Plan of Anschütz (1912) Compass.</div></div>

<p>Attached to the spider A—and therefore forming a
portion of the sensitive element—is a sheet metal annular
casing of the section shown at E E or F F. The gyros are
enclosed within this casing. Ventilating tubes and baffles
G are provided at points on the casing between each pair
of gyros. The compass card—in the form really of a ring—is
attached to the casing at H. Regarding the casing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
and the spider A as the equivalent of the horizontal ring
shown in our diagram (<a href="#ip_41">Fig. 41</a>), it will be noticed that the
gyro casings are not fixed rigidly to it, but are really
mounted on ball bearings surrounding their stalks, so
that they may rotate about a vertical axis relatively to
the rest of the sensitive element. As shown in the plan
view, however, the casing of the gyro K is connected by
two springs J to the rest of the sensitive element, so that
in whichever way the gyro turns on the ball bearings it
applies through one or other of the springs a force in the
same direction to the annular casing, etc. The gyro is
therefore substantially, though not actually, rigidly
connected to the rest of the sensitive element, the springs
being introduced to provide a yielding connection which
will prevent the full force of a sudden turn of the ship
from being thrown all at once on to the gyro. The gyros
L M are similarly connected to the rest of the sensitive
element, but in their case one pair of springs is made to
serve both gyros by employing links and a bell-crank
lever. The springs, it may be remarked, undoubtedly do
play a part in the transmission of the directive force from
the gyros to the card and in the avoidance of the quadrantal
error. But their presence is not essential to the
fundamental principle of action of the compass.</p>

<p>The damping system of the 1912 design is of a very
simple nature, and represents a great improvement over
the air blast method previously used. Although the
wheels are not required to act as blowers, their casings
are not exhausted of air. The casings, in fact, are
perforated with four large holes on each side, the cooling
effect of the circulating air being regarded as of more
value in practice than the saving of power which would
result if the wheels were run in an exhausted atmosphere.</p>

<p>The damping force is supplied by the weight of a body
of oil contained within a trough N extending right round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
the foot of the annular casing containing the gyros. This
trough, a circle as seen in plan, is blocked by eight bulkheads,
one each below the north and south points of the
compass card, and the others equally spaced round the
trough. Through each bulkhead a short pipe passes, so
that the oil in the trough may flow from one compartment
to another. With the exception, however, of the
north and south bulkhead pipes, which are quite free in the
bore, the passage of the oil is restricted by means of a
wire partially filling the bores of the pipes. By varying
the size of wire used, the restriction to the flow of the oil
from one compartment to the others, and therefore the
rate at which the oil will flow when the sensitive element
tilts, can be regulated to give the degree of damping
required or to suit any change of viscosity in a fresh
supply of oil.</p>

<p>The system in principle has much in common with
the Brown method of damping. Should the compass
card suffer an easterly deflection, the north point of the
card will, as we know, tend to rise under the influence of
the earth’s rotation, and will continue to rise until the
turning moment applied by the deflected pendulum
weight precesses the card back to the meridian, whereafter
the north point of the card passing over towards the
west will begin to fall towards the horizontal plane, and
then, descending still farther, it will once more come back
to the meridian. During this compound motion the oil in
the trough flows backwards and forwards, accumulating
below the south point of the card when the north point of
the card is rising and gathering below the north point
when the north point is falling. In other words, there is
an excess weight of oil below the southern point of the
card throughout the complete half-swing from east to
west, the maximum excess occurring when the card is
crossing the meridian. On the half-swing from west to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
east the excess weight of oil is below the northern point of
the card, the maximum excess occurring, as before, when
the card is crossing the meridian. The excess weight of oil
at all times thus tends to increase the rise or dip of the
north point of the card above or below the horizontal
plane, whereas the pendulum weight at all times tends to
diminish such rise or dip. Hence the excess weight of oil
tries to precess the card in the direction opposed to that in
which the pendulum weight is precessing it. The vibration
of the card in this compass, as in the Brown design,
is therefore damped by the generation of a counter-precessional
tendency, and not, as in the early Anschütz
and the Sperry designs, by precessing the sensitive
element in the direction required to reduce the angle by
which the pendulum weight is tilted away from the
plumb line.</p>

<p>From what we have already said regarding the Brown
system of damping, it will readily be inferred that there is
no latitude error in the Anschütz 1912 compass. The
damping force is equivalent to a reduction in the weight
of the pendulum “bob,” and is not applied directly to
reduce the tilt of the bob. The tilt of the pendulum
weight required in north or south latitudes to provide the
appropriate rate of westerly or easterly precession is not
opposed by the damping force called into play by such
tilt. Instead, the damping force merely makes the bob
lighter, so that the tilt has to be carried farther before the
<em>effective</em> weight of the bob can balance the tilting action
of the earth’s rotation. The balance will be automatically
struck when the moment of the effective weight
of the bob is just sufficient to generate the required rate
of westerly or easterly precession appropriate to the
latitude.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the three gyros at the corners of an
equilateral triangle and the general form given to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
annular casing and the rest of the sensitive element results
in the distribution of the mass of the sensitive element in
a very uniform manner around the vertical axis. There
is no excessive concentration of the mass towards the east
and west plane, and as a result it is unnecessary to add
compensator weights to this compass in order to avoid the
effects of centrifugal force during quadrantal rolling.</p>

steel, and are mounted on axles of the de Laval type—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>that
is to say, they are tapered and made of very small
diameter (about 0.15 in. at the parallel ends)—in order
that they may yield a little should the centre of gravity
of the wheel not be truly coincident with the centre line
of the shaft. The wheels are 5 in. in diameter, weigh
5 lb. 2 oz., and run at 20,000 revolutions per minute.
The motors are of the squirrel-cage type with the rotor
windings fixed to the wheels inside a recess concentric
with the axle. The field coils are fixed relatively to the
gyro casing. It is of interest to note that when the gyro-wheel
is being run up to its full speed—an operation
taking about five minutes to complete—the axle passes
through three critical speeds. These speeds are approximately
7000, 11,000, and 14,000 revolutions, and are
believed to be associated, the first with one end of the
axle, the second with the other end, and the third with a
combined action at both ends. During the period of
running up the gyros the starting current is, of course,
heavier than the current taken to drive the wheels at the
top speed, and as a result a considerable temperature is
developed in the wheels and their casings. When, however,
the gyros have been running for some time at the
top speed the temperature drops, and throughout the
compass remains fairly constant at about 150 deg. Fahr.
The viscosity of the damping oil, on the constancy of
which the constancy of the damping force depends, is
therefore less affected by external atmospheric changes of
temperature than might be expected. The oil used is a
mineral one. It serves not only to damp the vibrations
of the card, but also to lubricate the gyro-axles. To this
end, as shown in <a href="#ip_51">Fig. 51</a>, pipes are led down from each
end of each axle to dip into the oil trough, the flow of oil
being induced by means of wicks inside the pipes.</p>

<p>The method adopted for the transmission of the
readings from the master compass to the repeaters is of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
considerable interest. The bowl C containing the
mercury and the float is surrounded by two semi-cylindrical
strips P Q of silver-plated brass. At one of
the gaps between these strips the two abutting edges are
faced with platinum. The gap between these platinum
faces is 0.11 in. in width, and into it there is inserted, as
shown in the plan view, a platinum-iridium ball R,
measuring 0.095 in. in diameter.</p>

<p>On the switchboard serving the compass there is a
reversible motor, two of the windings of which are
constantly connected to a generator—the same generator
as serves the gyro-motors. The contact ball R is connected
to the third phase of the generator, while the two
strips P Q are connected to the third winding of the
reversible motor, this winding being duplicated in such a
way that the motor revolves in one direction or the other,
according as the circuit is completed at the ball R through
the strip P or the strip Q. A commutator is mounted on
the axle of the reversible motor, and from it current is
distributed to the motors operating the repeaters and to
the “follow-up” motor S (<a href="#ip_51">Fig. 51</a>). The latter motor is
geared to the shaft carrying the bowl C, and when
started up by the reversible motor turns the bowl in
the direction required to restore the ball R to the middle
of its slot, and so break the connection with the strip
P or Q. Thus when the ship’s course is altered the bowl
tends to rotate with the ship, but the ball R is mounted
on the sensitive element, and therefore maintains its
position. Contact is thus established between the ball
and one of the strips P Q, the reversible motor is set
rotating in the appropriate direction, and current is
distributed to the “follow-up” motor S to rotate the
bowl relatively to the ship until the ball R is once more
lying midway in the gap. The tendency of the bowl to
rotate with the ship is thus counteracted; the action of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
the “follow-up” motor practically results in the bowl
being held in constant relationship to the sensitive
element substantially as though it were part thereof.
Simultaneously the cards of the repeaters are prevented
from rotating with the ship, so that virtually they, too,
act as if rigidly connected to the sensitive element, without,
however, any frictional drag being thrown from them
on to the sensitive element.</p>

<p>As illustrating the refined construction of the entire
compass, the design of the ball contact may be noticed.
The ball is carried at the end of a tapered spiral spring.
It is free to rotate on the spring end, but is prevented
from moving axially thereon. The spring end is provided
with a button. The ball is drilled out and beaded over the
button. To ensure good electrical contact at all times
between the ball and the spring a drop of mercury is
carried inside the ball between it and the button. Should
the ship turn very suddenly the ball may spring out of the
gap and be dragged across the face of one or other of the
strips P Q. It is for this reason that these strips are
silver-plated.</p>

<p>The repeater compasses are provided not only with an
ordinary card graduated from 0 deg. to 160 deg., but also
with an inner dial which makes one revolution for an
alteration of 10 deg. in the ship’s course. This dial is
graduated to 1/10 deg., and permits very small departures
from the set course to be immediately noticed and
corrected. An elaboration of the same idea is provided
in the multiple repeater of the Brown compass.
In this repeater the inner dial is the ordinary 360 deg.
card. The outer annular dial makes four revolutions
for every complete turn of the ship. With the ship
sailing due north the graduations on the outer dial are
numbered from 0 to 45 round the east half of the dial,
and from 360 to 315 round the west half. The numbers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
however, are not marked on the dial itself, but on the edges
of discs seen through slots in the dial. As the ship turns
from the north towards the east, the discs on the west
side of the dial are successively rotated one stage as the
south end of the lubber line passes over them, so as to
exhibit numbers forming a continuation of the numbers
on the east side of the dial. The outer magnified dial is
thus of itself sufficient for navigational purposes.</p>

<p>In the Anschütz equipment arrangements are made for
attaching an azimuth mirror to the repeater dial for the
purpose of providing an artificial horizon during the
taking of bearings. A separate gyroscopically stabilised
artificial horizon device, such as is sometimes to be found
on board ships, is thus rendered unnecessary.</p>

latitude and <i>b</i> a constant dependent upon the design of the compass.
In the Sperry correction mechanism the value of the quantity <i>b</i> is

(<i>a</i> K cos C)/cos L, where K is the ship’s speed, L the angle of latitude,
C the angle between the course and the north and south direction, and <i>a</i>
a constant involving the speed of rotation of the earth. In the Sperry
correction mechanism the value of the quantity <i>a</i> is represented by the

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The ballistic deflection is dependent upon the <em>rate</em> at which the
northerly component of the ship’s speed is being changed. The
difference in the north steaming errors is dependent upon the <em>initial</em>
and <em>final</em> values of the speed towards the north, and would not appear
to be affected by the length of time occupied in changing the speed.
It would seem, therefore, that the ballistic deflection can only be dead-beat
in the chosen latitude if the speed towards the north is reduced
or increased at one particular rate. Thus if the ship is steaming due
north at 20 knots and changes its speed to 10 knots in (<i>a</i>) 10 minutes or
(<i>b</i>) 5 minutes, the initial and final values of the north steaming error
will be the same in both cases, since the initial and final speeds are the
same, but the ballistic deflection will be greater in the second case than
in the first, since the rate at which the speed is changed is greater. If,
then, the ballistic deflection is dead-beat in the first case it cannot be so
in the second. The statement that the ballistic deflection in the chosen
latitude is dead-beat thus appears, it may be suggested, to require
qualification. On the other hand, the British Admiralty in connection
with the use of gyro-compasses on destroyers and similar fast-manœuvring
vessels wherein the ballistic deflection is a factor of very great
importance has carried out lengthy experiments on the matter, and,
although the results have not been divulged, it is understood that the
ballistic deflection was found to be dead-beat independently of the rate
at which the speed was changed.</p></div>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
